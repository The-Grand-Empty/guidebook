The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and those of the original Genome Convergence Project could hardly be called anything but noble.

Bring people, families, and the galaxy together, allow love to transcend species boundaries, and use technology to unify all of the galaxy's many species into a single common intercompatible gene-pool.

The task the GCP set for itself _was_ an impossible one; yet, somehow, they managed it --- not just once, with one species, but again, and again. Genomes were sequenced, their cultures and people studied, and entire alternative theories of biochemistry refined and proven with each new planet. New, hybridized offspring stepped forth --- first in ones and twos, engineered at great expense for only the wealthiest, but then hundreds, millions, billions. The ideals and radical new technologies invented to make the dream possible spread like wildfire, star to star, species to species; at each new obstacle, some new innovative discovery proved a way forward. At last, _all_ could be truly human!

All across the galaxy, the fire burned; planets colonized, subjugated by outsiders; species bred nearly out of existence towards some homogenous barely-distinguishable average.

  > Design Goals
  > 
  > Explore a society where romance itself is commodified as part of a hypercapitalist market economy. Detail the fundamental and systematic obstacles to interspecies equity in a massively cosmopolitan society.
  >
  > Engage with reconstructive elaborations on fantasy and sci-fi tropes. Develop unique characters, cultures, and social situations that connect with each other in unusual and unexpected ways.
  > 
  > Explore and justify the existence of interspecies intersexuality and reproductive hybridization. Enable readers to engage with fantasies about character sexuality and erogeny.
