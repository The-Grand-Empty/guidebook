One of the cornerstones of the GCP as a literary element is the exploration of its colonial consequences, and nowhere are they more thoroughly on display than in the Marriage Markets system.

The Marriage Market system is part of an exploitative hypercapitalist regime that often arises in the wake of the GCP's "successes", where the pecuniary and prurient interests of colonizers and relatively-impoverished new species lead to a form of hyper-commodified prostitution where even love itself becomes something to be bought and sold at the whims of market forces.

# Social Classes

### Constituent

Default legal category for most persons.  
Highly local, you are a constituent of a particular planet/gov't and are subject to local rule.

### Concubine

A sort of 'galactic citizenship' status, at least within GCP areas of the galaxy.  
Much easier to become a concubine than to go back.  
Only concubines are permitted to prostitute themselves or otherwise transact sex or engage in a concubinage contract with constituents.  
Usually fairly robust legal protections, at least in theory.  
Mandatory HEC rating, labeling/advertising requirements.  
Tarriff minimums based on HEC rating.  
Concubines negotiate concubinage contracts with available clients. Contracts are always finite, though renewal isn't unknown; concubine becomes part of the client's household for the duration and is expected to maintain fidelity to them for it.  
Normally expected to bear/sire one or more children by their client during a term, up to the terms of the contract and ordinary standards of care. (Good-faith effort to ensure their fertility/virility and remain appropriately available for their client to have functional intercourse with for the term.)  
Usually also expected to do other tasks as part of the client's household.  
Concubinage contract terms secure child care and custody arrangements.

# The Markets

## Concubinage

The concubinage market operates in a way reminiscent of a commercial leased real-estate market. Concubines seek constituents willing to sign a concubinage contract, usually a four-year term in which the concubine becomes part of the client's household as the client's sexual partner.

Most concubinages include provisions that the concubine make a good-faith effort to sire or bear a child by their client, default boilerplate about participation in other household tasks, and provisions for the care and custody of any children after the concubinage term ends.

The money the client pays for the privilege is collected and paid to the concubine annually. Most markets also require the client to make some type of escrow deposit for or pay insurance against various types of misconduct or other eventualities. Concubines marketing themselves within a exchange are expected to pay the exchange's fees and any costs for services rendered themselves, as those costs can vary depending on how long the concubine needs to remain on the market and what techniques they use to market themselves to potential clients.

## Solicitation

Most exchanges exercise some sort of control over who is allowed to market themselves, in order to create a more exclusive atmosphere or gain a reputation for quality. For luxury resort stations like Paradise, this is governed by market forces through a medallion system. A concubine is required to purchase a station-specific concubinage medallion from a departing concubine in order to be allowed to solicit there; then once they have secured a contract they will sell it to a new arriving concubine as they leave to fulfill that contract.

## Fashion

Aboard an exchange like Paradise Station, public sexual nudity is hardly _indecent_ --- it's just good marketing. But if _everyone_ is naked, nobody is, and to avoid a race to the bottom that dilutes the sensual possibilities, the exchanges regulate the prevalence of public nudity, usually through a seasonal permitting system.

Once per orbit/season, Paradise Station auctions off a fixed number of seasonal nudity permits in various categories. Anyone wearing a so-called Categorized outfit must have a permit of an appropriate category they can exercise while wearing it in public. This is tracked and audited continuously by the station's electronic systems, and there _are_ fashion police that will intervene to issue fines if necessary.

These permits are sublicenseable, however --- most direct buyers in these auctions are therefore not individuals, but rather the station's major Fashion Departments, who are required to hold and sub-license applicable permits to any constituent who has purchased a Categorized outfit from them, any time said constituent wears said outfit in public areas.

Major Fashion Departments with permits in excess of what they need to cover their actively-worn fleet at any given moment, turn to an electronic timeshared derivatives market in order to recoup some of the excess cost.

Smaller independent Fashion Departments and guest coordinators participate in this market by buying [call options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option) on permits, in order to ensure they have access to appropriate permits for any Categorized outfit they sell (or, in the case of a guest coordinator, to ensure their constituent has the ability to wear a Categorized outfit they've brought from elsewhere). Concubines also participate in this market by selling [put options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option) to major Fashion Departments, who exercise them with any remaining inventory in order to have said concubine wear their Categorized outfit for marketing purposes.

In practice, this result in there being a practical floor to the price of clothing on Paradise Station --- and one that's high enough to make the material and manufacturing costs of any specific garment almost irrelevant. Fashion Departments rarely compete on price; they compete almost exclusively on product quality and customer relations. (For high-end suites, they'll even go as far as speculatively stocking wardrobes of clothing, custom-tailored to fit the specific guest.) There's particular incentive to offer and push more modest styles, too --- they can often be sold at nearly the same prices as Categorized outfits, but the cost to the Fashion Department normally associated with an associated permit becomes just pure profit.
