The **Xenofertility Grade System**, aka **HEC Grade**, is a systematized approach developed by GCP researchers as way to categorize and measure xenofertility and evaluate the relative performance of various genetic modifications and other interventions in pursuit of a unified galactic gene-pool.

With a galaxy full of nothing _but_ exceptions, the fact that it even _almost_ manages to be consistent is just one more miracle to feather the GCP's cap --- and like so many other achievements, with the way the system has since been co-opted, misused, and fetishized in the public imagining as a proxy for an individual's attractiveness, and the role it often plays in justifying colonial abuses, you're not wrong to imagine it a curse more than a blessing.

## Xenofertility Grades
HEC Grades consist of a letter and then a number, concatenated together (e.g. `T8`). The letter designates the 'fertility class', one of a number of broad classifications that attempt to reflect categorical compatibility concerns; the number reflects the 'fecundity exponent', a value that is at once more _and_ less precise than the fertility class in its attempt to capture an individual's degree of general reproductive xenocompatibility.

### Fertility Class

{: .note}
> Fertility class letters **do not stand for anything.** These letters are chosen at random with specific avoidance of obvious words or ideas associated with what they describes; new classes you invent for new situations should do likewise.

Class R
: _exoparous_[^exoparous], _spermatogenic_[^spermatogenic], _phallic_[^phallic]; (nom. human male)

Class T
: _viviparous_[^viviparous], _ovogenic_[^ovogenic], _yonic_[^yonic]; (nom. human female)

Class B/U
: _oviparous_[^ovoparous], _ambigenic_[^ambigenic], _hermaphroditic_[^hermaphroditic]; (nom. elysian)
- B is an obsolete category letter denoting a biochemical incompatibility that was previously suspected to be insurmountable; however some species' authorities still assign it as a matter of tradition.

Class C
: _tertigenic_[^tertigenic]
- Grades with this class letter use a "composite" fecundity rank that evaluates an individual in combination with a hypothetical standardized ternary partner

Class L
: _oviparous_[^ovoparous], _ovogenic_[^ovogenic], _yonic_[^yonic]; (nom. kastikani female)

### Fecundity Exponent

The number in an HEC grade, the fecundity exponent attempts to assign scores to individuals that model a bevy of biochemical and other non-categorical physiological factors that lead to, at the demographic level, differences in the fecundity rate within xenocouples with varying species and individual traits.

In theory, it's supposed to correspond to a 'standardized partial log odds of conception' -- where, two "taxonomically unrelated" individuals of "compatible fertility classes", both with fecundity exponent 6, should theoretically have 1:1 odds of conceiving a child if they engage in "reference mating behaviors" over a 4-year period. Each point higher or lower than that represents a 6-fold increase or decrease to those odds --- i.e. a T7/R7 couple should have 6:1 odds in favor; T5/R5 should have about 1:6 odds against, and a T6/R7 should have odds around 2.45:1 in favor.

## Consequences

TODO
- interplanetary distances = regional authorities
- often a medical board of some kind
- lots of incentives to trying to fudge the numbers one way or another
- system has to constantly be amended to deal with new exceptions
- evaluation process can itself be a vector for abuse
