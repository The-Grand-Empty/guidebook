### Human
Within the GCP culture, almost any of the species listed here with HEC hypercompatibility genes or another form of xenocompatibility could be colloquially referred to as a human, lower-case-h.

Capital-H **Human**, though, specifically denotes the earth-origin bipedal species from whom most HEC hypercompatibility genes were derived. Who is or isn't a Human, legally, is a contentious topic.

### Crogulon
The **Crogulons** are the boogeymen of Marriage Market culture. Though the fears about them may or may not be overblown, it's inarguable that they're the reason New Species Integration programs are now _far_ more cautious about allowing members of new untested species to take concubines: A century ago, a pair of Crogulon queens were invited to take full harems as part of _their_ previously-smooth species integration, and subsequently _ate_ them.

### Djinai
The **Djinai** are a race of beings who seem to draw from the 'biblically' accurate angel model --- they have radially-symmetric faces with eight eyes centered around a small squid-like beak, which might charitably be described as giving the impression of a flower. They ordinarily wear floor-length gowns and veils that conceal them from head to toe. This modesty norm serves a practical purpose of keeping a Djinai's gas-phase hormones contained and preventing atmospheric contaminants from influencing their emotional state.

### Elysian
The **Elysians** are the native species of the planet Elinsia, characterized by retractable luminescent wings, oviparity, and undifferentiated external genitalia.

### Iruvian
The **Iruvians** are 'space furries', noted as one of the earliest species with which humans were successfully able to prove the HEC hybridization concept. They make excellent lawyers.

### Kastikani
The **Kastikani** are space dwarves, known as some of the best craftsmen and engineers in the galaxy and also for the elaborately-decorated shrines built into every piece of that engineering to show respect to the Kami they believe are every bit as important to their success.

### Takrak
The **Takraks** are long segmented hexapods, noted for their relatively high xenofertility given their less-common body plan; and for aesthetic sensibilities that revolve more around smell than sight.

### Telarnan
The **Telarnans** are 'space elves'. They are noted for a trait referred to as 'aposexuality', in which they gain and lose their primary sex characteristics in response to relationship status changes.

### Thaboton
The **Thabotons** are 'space giants' native to the planet Thabos, notable for their immense stature and strength even when heavily hybridized into humans.

### Veran
The **Verans** are a species characterized by shimmering skin and an appearance that makes them seem both distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine depending on fairly subtle shifts in their expressions or lighting.
