## Basics

### Body Plan

Hivefolk are bipedal humanoids. Externally they resemble humans quite strongly, with the exception of their segmented abdomen, moth-like wings, and genitalia.

The average hivefolk female stands 5'0" tall, weighs 100 lbs, and has a wingspan of 5'4".
The average hivefolk male stands 5'2" tall, weighs 100 lbs, and has a wingspan of 4'6".

### Sexual Dimorphism

Hivefolk have two anatomical and reproductive sexes: female and male. Females are traditionally gendered as queens or princesses depending on age/life cycle phase, and male individuals are traditionally gendered as drones. The demographic ratio female:male varies between populations from 1:2 to 1:6.

Hivefolk are sexually dimorphic on wing size, shape, and patterning. Female wings are larger, and have smaller and more numerous stripes or other pattern features. Male wings have simpler patterns often composed of brighter colors than their counterparts.

Certain populations, such as those of *Wild Sceptre*, are sexually dimorphic on dactylity. Females have six fingers to a hand with a doubled thumb, while males have five fingers. This dimorphism is not present in some other populations.

### Paedomorphism

Hivefolk have a number of anatomically-distinct life cycle phases.

Hivefolk are born as "eggs" by their queen mother. On hatching, the juvenile "nymphs" are equivalent to a human toddler. On reaching maturity, members of the species develop insect-like wings and become more substantially sexually dimorphic.

Adult males are referred to as "drones" or sometimes "princes". There is no anatomical distinction between the terms; calling a male a "prince" is a cultural distinction equivalent to calling a human man a "batchelor".
Mature females are initially "princesses", and will assemble a harem of drones.

Once a harem is assembled, a "princess" develops into a "queen" with a transition analogous to human female menarche, associated with her gaining the ability to lay eggs.

### Oviparity

Hivefolk queens lay eggs in clutches. A queen's clutch size is most often approximately one more than her harem size. Only one egg in a clutch is female; all others are male.

### Polyandry

This species forms family units of one queen and usually 2-6 drones; the drones are collectively referred to as her "harem".

### Haplodiploidy

Hivefolk have haploid ova deriving from meiosis of the diploid queen mother. Hivefolk also have haploid sperm, but male hivefolk are themselves also haploid and sperm are produced via mitosis rather than meiosis.

### Fertilization

Hivefolk eggs are fertilized internally before they are laid. The queen mother will mate with most or all of the drones in her harem in the period before the beginning of ovulation and during her pregnancy with the egg clutch. Sperm received by mating via her bursaria are stored in her spermatheca, and then released to the ovaries during the narrow fertilization window of the developed ova. Sperm can also be introduced directly to the ovary if the queen mates during that fertilization window, but this doesn't often result in successful fertilization.

Hivefolk have 'bifurcated ova'; during Meiosis II, the parent dihaploid cell splits into two equally-sized haploid ova rather than a single ova and a polar body. The two haploid ova remain bound to each other after dividing their cell membrane, and develop a shared zona pellucida that wraps around both of them.

Once a sperm fuses into the egg and merges in with one of the two halves, the entire egg becomes unreceptive to further sperm. Following this, one of the two halves undergoes apoptosis and then autophagy by the other half in a process that selects for the sex of the final offspring by either leaving only the 'female' diploid half that fused the sperm or only the 'male' monoploid half that didn't, after which the egg is considered fertilized. (Note that for 'male' eggs, where the monoploid half envelops the diploid half, a few specific genetic elements from the enveloped cell originating in the sperm also end up incorporated into the male offspring genome.)

## Skeletal System

Hivefolk have a mixture of exoskeletal and endoskeletal features. Their limbs are mostly endoskeletal, with internal bones that support an exterior flesh cladding, while the body trunk is exoskeletal. A hivefolk's shoulders, hips, face, and fingers feature both exoskeletal and endoskeletal members.

Each of a hivefolk's nine body trunk segments is covered with a distinct exoskeletal scute, numbered from I to IX.

#### Cranial Scute I

The cranial scute covers a hivefolk's head, from their brow ridge to their atlas, resembling a helmet. The nasal process that extends down to form a hivefolk's nose is also part of the cranial scute.

#### Cervical Scute II

The cervical scute covers a hivefolk's neck, from their atlas to their clavicle. It features two small openings for a hivefolk's ears at the back of the neck, referred to as their otoforamen.

#### Thoracic Scute III

The thoracic scute covers a hivefolk's thorax, from their clavicle to the navel analog point, resembling a breastplate. This is the largest individual scute of a hivefolk's body, and has a structural and protective function similar to a human's ribcage. It features several clefts at its superior edge that create clearances for the arms and wings, referred to as the humeral margins and alar margins.

#### Abdominal Scutes IV \- VIII

The five abdominal scutes cover a hivefolk's belly and lower back, from the navel analog point to the pelvic ridges and pubis analog point. These scutes are narrow, with a significant portion of each overhanging the scute below.

#### Coxal Scute IX

The coxal scute covers a hivefolk's groin and genitals, from the pubis analog point to the perineum. This scute has a forked process at the distal end, referred to as the 'annelus'. This structure is substantially dimorphic between female and male hivefolk. (See the section on reproductive anatomy for details.)

#### Phalangic Scutes

The phalangic scutes cover the tips and joints of a hivefolk's fingers and toes. The exact set of phalangic scutes varies substantially from population to population. The digits are designated with the letter L for levo=left hand and D for dextro=right hand, followed by the digit number from 1 to 4 or thumb number from T1 to T2 (or just T on a single-thumbed individual), followed by a letter 'a' for the tip scute, 'b', 'c' for scutes behind this.

The majority population of *Wild Sceptre* has scutes a and b on all fingers and thumbs, with approximately 40% of individuals also having scutes L4c and D4c.

## Wings

A hivefolk's wings develop during 'alarche', one of the transformations that occurs during puberty in both female and male hivefolk. Pre-alarche, a juvenile's thoracic scute extends fully across their back up to their neck, with no alar margin. As alarche progresses this rim retreats back, leaving a elastic fibrous membrane referred to as the 'wing silk' spanning the gap, that swells to accommodate the bundles of wing strands growing underneath it.

Each of a hivefolk's wing follicles begins as a wing-bud stem cell; these cells generate during incubation, and once a hivefolk has hatched the number of wing follicles is fixed. Most of the wing growth a hivefolk experiences over their lifetime happens during alarche, in the period between when these wing-bud cells subdivide and develop into wing follicles and when the wing-silk dries and is shed.

Wing strands are the wide, thin ribbons of material that interlock together by the hairs that cover their surfaces to form wing panels. Each wing follicle extrudes a single strand, with a width that depends on the follicle density to produce wider strands when there are fewer follicles.

As the wings grow, they are kept moist and protected by the wing silk. Once the wing silk dries and cracks at the end of alarche, it is shed, and the wing strands unfurl down an individual's back to be preened into panels. While the strands remain moist, the hairs covering them remain flexible; as they dry, these hairs curl tightly and interlock with each other to establish the wing's final shape.

Wing strands and follicles are organized into four distinct bundles by the four groups of alar muscles that develop during alarche, making for laterally symmetric forewing and hindwing pairs. Each wing is articulated in flexion-extension, erection-adduction, and pronation, by corresponding muscle groups and tendons; with the flexor alaris muscles responsible for wingbeats being the largest and most powerful.

While shedding at the end of alarche, some populations, and especially female hivefolk of those populations, are prone to becoming 'wing bound'. This is a condition caused by an excessively-thick wing silk that retains significant strength after it dries, resulting in the partially-shed silk becoming tangled in the soft wing strands. This can often be resolved with assistance from a family member, but many cultures will prefer to have an expert perform the procedure to avoid even a slight risk of damage, due to the high level of importance given to an individual's wings, especially a princess's.

### Social Sexuality

Hivefolk are socially sexual. While sex does serve a reproductive function of conveying sperm from male drones to female queens to fertilize the queen's eggs, it also serves functions related to social relationship formation, and as a pleasure-seeking behavior --- even within relationships that are fully precluded from being reproductive such as homosexual or interspecies relationships.

### Genitalia

Female hivefolk have two distinct external openings into their reproductive tract: their bursaria, and their oviduct. Queens routinely use either or both of these openings for sexual intercourse with drones in their harem.

Male hivefolk have a single laterally-asymmetric penis that is routinely used for sexual intercourse both between a drone and his queen and between a drone and other drones in his queen's harem. Additionally, males have a disconnected structure homologous to the bursaria called the sacculus; though it has no direct reproductive function in males, it's considered part of the reproductive system as drones routinely use this opening for sexual intercourse with other drones.

One of the main externally-visible features of the genital anatomy of both sexes is the pelvic plate, a remnant of the ninth and bottom-most abdominal segment of the species' evolutionary ancestors. The pelvic plate is a thin cartilaginous structure with approximately the texture and stiffness of the human earlobe. It is rooted at the top edge of the pelvic region where the vestigial bottom edge of the eighth abdominal segment plate bulges or overhangs it slightly. The plate is considerably larger on females than males.

For a female hivefolk, her pelvic plate covers almost the entirety of her pelvic region, with each of the lateral free edges of her plate approximating loosely into her inguinal cleft on each side. Her plate curves down between her legs and terminates in her perineal space, with some anatomical variation on whether it extends to just cover her ovipositor or leave it exposed.

The space between her plate and her pelvis is referred to as the bursarial vestibule. The bursaria itself is a duct that terminates into her vestibule at its introitus, located just below the top edge of her vestibule.

The female's bursaria extends centrally inward from that point to an internal point where it meets her upper spermathecal ducts at her copulatrix.

### Intercourse

During penile-bursarial intercourse between a queen and a drone, the drone inserts his penis in through the side of her bursarial vestibule under one of the lateral free edges of her pelvic plate --- a queen's pelvic plate is flexible enough to hinge and stretch forward to admit this insertion easily through the gap this movement produces at her inguinal cleft on either side.

The shape of a drone's penis is laterally asymmetric as a result of evolutionary optimization around being able to 'turn the corner' around from this initial lateral insertion to an angle that can seat up against the introitus to enable him to advance his penis up into her bursaria to a length that positions his vesica (the organ at the tip of his penis) in her copulatrix. Once positioned here he will ejaculate to deposit his semen, at this point where the sperm carried by it can travel through her upper spermathecal ducts to her spermatheca.

For a male hivefolk, his pelvic plate is much smaller than for a female. Though the upper portions of the lateral free edges may sometimes approximate into the upper portions of his inguinal cleft on both sides (depending on anatomical variation), the lower portion of the pelvic plate that extends down and under is always much narrower than his thigh gap and terminates much further forward in a pair of forked prongs referred to as his anellus. The shape of this narrowing is usually asymmetrical with one free edge approximates his inguinal cleft on one side much further than the other to leave a large permanent gap on the other side exposing the vincular sinus (a space homologous to the bursarial vestibule).

At the opposite side of the male's vincular sinus from his pelvic plate is his valva, an articulated flap that can close partially or completely over that opening, or open to in order to erect his penis out through the opening. (There are some vestigial structures on the opposite side of another symmetric valva that is also present on both sides for a female, but only the male's single developed valva is motile.)

During penile-sacculic intercourse between two drones, a drone inserts the tip of his penis into the upper portion of his partner's vincular sinus above the partner's penis and through into the partner's sacculus; he will often ejaculate there in a similar manner to in a female partner's copulatrix. This can sometimes be done reciprocally, where a laevo drone and a dextro drone both insert the their penii into the other's sacculi at the same time while facing each other, but this is only practical between drones with the opposite asymmetry from each other; otherwise in a given session between two drones it's more likely to be done either only one way or one at a time sequentially.

The other opening that a female hivefolk has, the oviduct opening through her ovipositor, is homologous to the male's vesica at the tip of his penis. When she is aroused, the erectile tissue of her ovipositor inflates and can cause the front opening of her ovipositor to protrude downward between her legs by several inches, and in females whose pelvic plate extends to cover her ovipositor that includes pushing it aside. From a functional perspective, this serves both to ensure that her eggs are deposited clear of fecal residue from the adjacent anus, and also to exclude easy entry by a partner's penis during sex unless specific care is taken to line up to have penile-ovian intercourse.

During penile-ovian sexual intercourse between a drone and a queen, the drone aligns the tip of his penis with the ovipositor's central hollow at its tip and inserts his penis up through the oviduct. Though the shape of the male's penis is actually more of an obstacle than an aid here, this matters a lot less as a queen's oviduct is significantly more elastic than her bursaria (as it must pass much larger eggs during laying while her bursaria only need be able to admit a partner's penis) and it can accommodate his shape.

The male inserts his penis up through his partner's oviduct up to place his vesica in the cervical junction where the lower spermathetical ducts and the two ovaries join the oviduct, and will ejaculate to deposit his semen there. This bypasses the role of her spermatheca in regulating fertilization by exposing the potentially-unfertilized eggs in her ovary to his sperm directly, but rarely results in actual fertilization unless the queen has penile-ovian intercourse within a very narrow time window around the beginning of an ovulation.

While a queen is late-term pregnant with developed eggs, some eggs may have already descended past the cervical junction and a drone having penile-ovian sex with a queen may be inserting his penis up past some of the eggs of her developing clutch, if they're not *so* large at that point to block the duct entirely.

Other forms of sexual intercourse such as anal or oral are also possible but the details are not any different for hivefolk as for most species.
