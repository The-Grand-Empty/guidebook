## Governance

### God-Empress and the Grand Hive

Central treaty organization and traditional origin of hivefolk as a whole, and theoretically the hegemony in charge of the species' territorial claims in the galaxy. Only 60% of hivefolk recognise the grand hive at an administrative level rather than just in name, but over 90% recognise the God-Empress as an important cultural leader.

### Lord-Empress and her Hive

Hivefolk are almost exclusively spaceborne, with the majority of the population residing on massive hiveships--- large low-gravity spaceborne complexes that can often house upward of 10 million hivefolk each. The larger of these stations are usually kept permanently parked in useful planetary orbits from which resources can be efficiently gathered and processed; while other smaller more mobile hiveships often serve more defensive or commerce-oriented functions.

Hiveships within a given star system often recognise the authority of a  centralized admiralty-like structure, or can sometimes consider themselves members of a local interspecies treaty organization or coalition.

### Empress and her Mission

Hiveships are usually divided up into Missions, individual communities of around a hundred to a thousand queens led by a local Empress. In more peacetime contexts these missions are usually divided up geographically based on different sectors of a hiveship, but in military contexts missions are usually divided up based on role.

A hiveship's Lord-Empress is also the Empress of the Administrative Mission on ships large enough to have a distinct administrative mission. An especially large hiveship might have a separate Fore CO2 Scrubbers Mission and Aft CO2 Scrubbers Mission, while a smaller hiveship might have a single unified Life Support mission encompassing those and more.

A single wing of spacefighters might have either a single mission associated with both maintenance and operations for smaller units, or separate operations and maintenance missions for larger units.

For ships small enough to need only a single mission, typically only expeditionary ships and outposts directly associated with the Grand Hive maintain the Lord-Empress title for their leader, unless operating as a fleet with other ships of this class.

### Queen and her Family

A queen and her associated drones, together her 'harem' and all combined a 'family', acts as the basic organizational unit in both social and military contexts. When there's a clear subdivision of tasks available such as crewing an individual spacefighter, families will often end up sized to match the needs of that task subdivision.

Trade ships too small for an entire Mission but too large to be operated by a single Family will often fill the gap with a larger proportion of princesses and prince drones on their 'nupital tours', or be operated by a pair or more of co-queens with a larger shared harem.

## Names

Hivefolk have names that consist of a personal name, followed by an honor-name consisting of a hyphenated sequence of honors. (See [https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/pathfinder-anadi-names.php](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/pathfinder-anadi-names.php) for inspiration.)

The length of the honor-name has semantic meaning; the specific number of honors given conveys both gender and relationship information:
- Two honors indicates a prince-drone.
- Three honors indicates a married drone.
- Four honors indicates a princess, or a queen who's open to courtship.
- Five honors indicates a queen not open to co interested in courtship.
- Six honors or more can indicate a ship, mission, empress, or something else of similar dignity, though the rules are less standard.

Individuals can and do have more honors than this; but when they do they select a subset of the appropriate size to use, usually with some attention paid to constructing an appealing poetic-sounding phrase from them. 

Honors are awarded in a few different ways. During a hivefolk's childhood, their queen-mother will award them hereditary honors, i.e. from the family's collective set of honor-names, as part of recognising certain growth milestones. There are usually four recognised milestones, to ensure a princess has an appropriate full name by the time she begins her tour. Some cultures only award hereditary honors automatically at their first two milestimes, though --- especially to boys --- with the expectation that older children should work towards and be able to earn merit honors for the latter two.

Merit honors are awarded by a drone's queen, or by a prince-drone's, princess's, or queen's empress, based on some combination of achievement 

In some cultures, a hivefolk boy's personal name is considered 'private', i.e. normally not shared or used except with family. In these cultures, a nymph-drone or prince-drone will use their queen mother's personal name in public, and once married will use their queen wife's personal name. When required, brothers are disambiguated by their hereditary honors.

A queen's coronation name --- the name she'll use for the most formal of occasions and on official records --- consists of her own personal name and all of the honors earned by herself or any member of her harem, shortened to four or five honors depending on context. A drone's coronation name is similar, but takes only from his own and his queen wife's honors, rather than the full harem's; and is shortened to three honors for most practical usages.

In cases where this would leave a queen with two husbands with the _same_ name, the prince's personal name is also used -- and In the very rare and impressive  case where this would leave a queen's husband with the exact *same* full coronation name as her, the queen's name is modified further to append his prince-name (a recognition of this rare feat, of a drone having personally earned every honor his queen earned).

## Courtship

### Sex Appeal: Wings

The single most important anatomical feature a hivefolk has in terms of how 'attractive' or 'sexy' they are to other hivefolk is their wings. In fact, this is in some sense their primary function.

Only the most athletic of hivefolk are capable of more than momentary free flight under gravity equivalent to their origin planet (around 0.5g), and most hivefolk's wings are fragile enough to put them at a risk of injury if they were to attempt it. In the modern era of a spaceborne population, hivefolk do routinely use their wings propulsively in microgravity ships and stations; but that is an environment wholly different from the environment they evolved into.

The point at which a hivefolk molts their wing silk and "receives their wings" corresponds quite closely with sexual maturity for the species; it's the point at which a female nymph starts to be considered a princess, and a male nymph starts to be considered a drone, making the presence of wings a clear indicator that someone could be a potential mate.

Additionally, some features of wings function as markers that distinguish between sex.

'Feminine' wings have a larger wingspan, more intense coloration, and higher-density patterning such as dots or mottling. 'Masculine' wings are smaller and often have smoother gradients.

With the advent of modern innovations in healthcare, particularly prenatal egg care, drones often have wings much closer to those of a princess than their primitive ancestors would have. In some sense, the size and pattern of one's wings are a marker of an individual's health at a few critical points in childhood. In certain cases such as famine a drone may develop even smaller than normal wings. As such, there's some conflict over beauty standards for whether drones are more attractive with larger 'healthy' wings or smaller 'masculine' wings.

Wings also show some indication of age, in the sense that older hivefolk will usually have more faded colors and more accumulated small nicks and tears at the edges of their wings.

#### Cosmetic Enhancements
Various sorts of conditioners and makeup are sometimes used to subtly or not-so-subtly enhance the texture or patterns of an individual's wings.Permanent tattoos can also be applied for many of the same reasons as makeup.

'Fringing' is a more permanent modification that involves cutting and shaping a wing's edge. This can sometimes help disguise a minor injury, but more often this is done purely to create a more interesting or fanciful patterned fringe; repeated wavy or castellated patterns are popular in cultures where this is routinely done.

Prosthetic extensions can be used in cases of catastrophic damage. It's difficult to attach a partial prosthetic in a way that makes the joint look natural, so often the procedure involves cutting the wing down completely for an entirely prosthetic replacement, with some loss of function that's often considered acceptable for the aesthetic improvement.

### Mercantile vs Militant

Courtship traditions among hivefolk vary significantly, with one of the principal axes being how militarized the culture is.

Some hiveships are almost fully military "every drone a soldier, every queen a captain". Romantic and interpersonal details are considered an afterthought; what matters are skill synergies, and the need to rapidly train and organize individuals into functional-enough families to serve in the effort.

Other fully mercantile-traditionalist hiveships have longer, more protracted courtship processes; but most hiveships fall somewhere in the middle, borrowing some military traditions and formalities, but with a wide range of adaptations within each specific culture to strike their own balance between  individual choice and societal normalcy.

The point at which an individual becomes gravid with her first clutch of eggs is often considered the 'true' point when a princess transitions into being a queen --- but on a social level, the most important distinction between a "princess" and a "queen" is the level of obligation the princess or queen is understood to have to her drones (and vice versa).

### Fidelity and Obligation

Most cultures expect drones to maintain sexual fidelity to at most one single queen or princess at a time, with his only other partners aside from his wife being her other husbands or suitors, or perhaps her co-queen in some cases.

Suitors are ordinarily free to break up with a princess or even a queen, but it can even be criminal desertion in a military context for a husband to leave his queen without some type of formal process. A drone is not universally expected to be subservient, and in fact some features of society give a queen's harem a significant amount of power over their queen wife.

Most cultures expect princesses and queens to maintain sexual fidelity only within her harem, a group that usually contains 2-4 committed 'husbands' and is usually open to include some number of uncommitted ephemeral 'suitors'.

A princess is theoretically empowered to court any drones she chooses, but after the first is in practice subject to the approval of the suitors of her existing harem if she wishes them to remain so.

A queen may have almost any relationship dynamic with her suitors that she and they see fit, but she's normally considered to have a social obligation to her husbands collectively and individually, to maintain relationships with them and not favor or disfavor any of them too unevenly. A disgruntled husband may withhold his approval for a suitor that only she prefers, and the prolonged lack of any non-husband suitors is generally considered not very emotionally healthy for the queen *or* her husbands.

Most but not all cultures that recognise co-queen status extend that to allowing a queen's husbands to be suitors or husbands to her co-queen. Certain more conservative cultures without full co-queen recognition only officially consider sharing 'allowed' if the drone is only suitor to both.

Queens are usually not empowered to unilaterally end their relationship with one of their husbands the way they can with a suitor --- often, other members of her harem will strongly reject the attempt, from a place of brotherhood and friendship with them. In the case where a husband is especially disfavored by both her and the rest of her harem, though, it's usually possible for them to pressure him into agreeing to exit.

### Ensign Courtship

At the midpoint between mercantile and military culture, it's common to consider the rank of "cadet" to correspond to a princess or drone without any permanent attachment, and promotion to the rank of "ensign" to have an analogous function to the human idea of an "engagement".

An ensign starts when a princes' empress determines that the cadet-princess has a harem of suitors who've started to socially resemble a queen's more-committed harem, and often that she and the members of this harem have passed some competency milestones.

Usually, this promotion decision is announced by the empress as a surprise to at least the princess and often to her drones too, but is usually made on the  basis of observations about the social dynamic and information from others in the mission, making it only rarely an unpleasant surprise.

During the ensign period, you often see the 'trials and honors' tradition. The trials are a number of locally-defined difficult challenges that the ensign group is supposed to try to complete before coronation. The corresponding honors are usually awarded individually to the drone or princess to complete them, but most trials require some amount of teamwork from the rest of them to even allow that member to succeed. The putative aim is for the group to accumulate as many distinct honors between them, though more militaristic cultures may actually have hard or at least soft requirements that the group is expected to meet.

In some cultures, it's traditional for the empress to pre-emptively promote her entire ensign at once at the same time as promoting her; in others, only the ensign-princess is promoted, and its then traditional for whichever of her suitors earn an honor the ensign still currently lacks to be promoted to the ensign. (This can also sometimes be a fixup in a pre-emptive promotion culture when the empress has missed promoting a suitor who ought to have been included, or as a way to add a suitor who's relationship only developed to that point after the  start of the ensign.)

Ensigned suitors who a princess or her harem actively disfavors can also be pressured into retroactively declining the promotion up until the coronation, or in pre-emptive promotion cultures usually transferred to  another princess or queen --- or sometimes forced to the empress herself if she's promoted a drone who literally only she thinks is ok.

A coronation is a cultural ceremony with a meaning somewhere between a couple's wedding and an officer's commissioning. An ensign-princess becomes a queen at her coronation and receives her coronation name, and simultaneously becomes wife to the members of her ensign, who each become her husband and each receive their own coronation name. And, the family as a whole usually receives a specific commissioned assignment within the mission or sometimes elsewhere on the hiveship.

Other suitors may continue to be an ensign-princess's informal suitors throughout,  and still be the crowned  queen's suitors afterward, but it's rare for a suitor she already knew before coronation to become her husband later on. If or when a queen does take an additional suitor as a husband, there's often some amount of ceremony associated to make it official,  but usually it's mostly within the family itself, not part of a large public event. A family may choose to update names when this happens, but most don't.

## Child-rearing

### Gestation

Hivefolk have telotrophic meroistic ovarioles --- that is, each egg follicle remains tethered to the mother's ovaries via an umbilical cord. When a queen becomes pregnant, she will produce a series of soft-shelled eggs over several weeks, which are then laid one at a time on successive days.

The last egg is not laid, however, but is instead gestated internally and birthed live. Ordinarily, all of the eggs laid externally develop as boys, and only the egg gestated internally develops as a girl.

A boy's incubation development is nutrition-limited; that is, once the nutrition initially packaged with the fetus in his egg case runs out, the infant boy hatches. In addition to boys often hatching in a more underdeveloped and unhealthy state than girls, this is also one of the main drivers of masculine vs feminine wing features: wing bud stem cells only develop while still incubating or gestating, so girls are usually born with significantly denser wing buds (leading to larger wings and finer patterning later on).

However, modern medical innovations have been able to overcome this to some extent. When an egg is laid, the umbilical cord typically remains attached. In antiquity it would be allowed to dry over a short period to enable the egg to be detached, but modern procedure is to cut the cord and attach the egg's stub to a nutrient pump incubator. This leads to much healthier boys (but some malcontents also say it makes them more 'feminine').
