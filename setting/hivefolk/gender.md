One of the central goals of this species is to explore what it means for an individual to be gender-nonconforming in a world with radically different norms that conformance is judged against.

The earlier portions of this document describe what's generally considered to constitute "normal" for a hivefolk --- and in a very important sense, this section is no different. It is likely not even possible to give a complete description of all possible hivefolk genders, sexualities, or orientations across the trillions of individuals who make up its population.

This article, therefore, generalizes _heavily_ in an effort to usefully describe common ways hivefolk may be nonconforming.

## Baseline

### Princess vs Queen

Most anatomically female adults identify as a queen or princess and in general feel substantially more sexual attraction toward male-presenting drones than to other categories. Princesses are usually fairly explorative about their identity and interests, but most transition to queen as a distinct gender when they've established a stable harem of drone husbands centered around themselves. Queens generally are less promiscuously exploratory but are still generally exploratory with her husbands and other suitors her harem approves of.

Most nonconforming anatomically-female hivefolk are initially princesses who feel especially strong dysphoria even through later adulthood about the queen-gendered concepts of permanency, to the point of transferring that dysphoria to and rejecting the basic polyandry concept in favor of an identity associated with a broader (e.g. co-queen) or narrower (e.g. trans-drone) relationship structure.

### Drone

Most anatomically male adults identify as a drone. Some individuals make an identity distinction between a "prince" and "drone" that's analogous to the princess/queen distinction, but there's no specific biological impetus for drawing this distinction the way there is for a princess/queen.

Drones are generally more bisexual than princesses or queens, but less promiscuous, preferring to court only one princess or queen at a time. They also form strong bonds with other members of their queen or princess's harem. Homosexual attraction is not usually considered nonconforming for a drone, as non-platonic inter-harem relationships between drones are common and widely accepted; and though it can be odd if it's to the extent that he does not maintain a personal relationship with the harem's queen, such cases are ordinarily well-tolerated by society. An exclusively-homosexual drone can often become a queen's husband more on the basis of his relationships with her harem than with her.

### Incest

Some relationships that humans might be averse to as an incest-avoidant reflex are not nearly so taboo among hivefolk --- specifically, between a princess and members of her mother's harem.

It's usually still considered taboo for a queen's husbands to pursue her princess daughter, but not nearly so much for a queen's suitors. Only one of a queen's drones can be the biological father to any one of her daughters, but it's considered far more likely for it to be one of her husbands as usually none of the suitors the mother had around the daughter's conception will still be suitors by the time the daughter becomes a princess.

For this reason though, paternity testing is considered a little bit taboo, as the desire to dispel the cloud of uncertainty about biological parentage is often thought of as going hand-in-hand with a queen's husband feeling a desire to be disloyal to her or having already become more attached to the daughter than is considered healthy for someone culturally considered one of her fathers.

### Gift Drones

As stated though, there's rarely much of a taboo between a daughter and her mother's suitors the way there is with her mother's husbands. In some cultures it's even common for a queen to specifically court a new suitor to her own harem when her daughter is nearing adulthood, with the intent of then 'gifting' this suitor to her daughter when her daughter gains her wings as a princess.

Often this will involve placing this suitor in the family with a sort of mentor role to the daughter in the year or so leading up; this is done to place a more experienced drone who her family approves of as the first member of the princess's harem, with the associated role in helping guide her nuptial tour and influence what other drones she'll court in the process.

### Death and Divorce

Society isn't generally oriented around smaller families. When a queen and her drones receive a commission as part of their coronation, those commissions often involve executing important functions for the ship as a whole, with a workload that would make doing the job with fewer than 3-4 people difficult or impossible.

However, hivefolk's recent military history has left their cultures fairly well-acquainted with the idea of individual deaths within a family.

Death or divorce of a single drone is not ordinarily a catastrophic event. Queens are more-or-less already expected to be continuously recruiting potential suitors who could step into the place of a deceased husband, while a deceased suitor is functionally no different from a suitor who's just lost interest and decided to pursue some other princess or queen.

Sometimes though, and especially with multiple drone deaths at once, this can end up destabilizing a family's dynamic to the point where her harem may end up dissolving anyway.

Death of a queen, though, almost always leads to more significant social changes for the surviving widower husbands of her widower queenship. If there's a surviving daughter close to the right age, she might end up inheriting her mother's entire harem intact. Only one of her mother's husbands could possibly be her biological father, and this is one of the few cases where the practicalities of the situation can override the taboo on knowing which --- so that her confirmed father can act as a sort of temporary regent in the transition, while the others are freed to become suitors to the princess who's confirmed biologically unrelated to them.

In other cases --- and sometimes even in cases where there is a princess heir --- most large ships are equipped to be able to transfer a widower family to a less-demanding or less-essential role, but this is usually expected to be temporary --- either the harem manages to court some other princess as a whole, or it eventually dissolves as its individual members start pursuing other queens or princesses individually.

## Common Nonconformances

### Monoandry

A queen having too few husbands and suitors is usually considered a symptom of relationship distress: A queen who does not continue to pursue suitors out of her own lack of libido likely is also failing to sexually satisfy her existing harem. Excessively-disfavored husbands of a queen may feel jealous to the point of disapproving of further suitors, creating a feedback loop of animosity between a queen and her harem. Even a well-favored husband may feel dissatisfied, if their own emotional need for close relationships with other drones in their wife's harem isn't adequately met, or from a place of empathy for other queen-disfavored or otherwise discontent harem-mates.

While drones do, in some contexts, see each other as rivals, it's considered gender-nonconforming if it leads him to see other members of an ordinary well-adjusted harem as rivals in a way that precludes ordinary harem brotherhood.

Princesses and queens are expected to feel more human-equivalent rivalry toward other princesses and queens, but in some cases this can also extend to jealousy about intimate relationships between her own drones, especially if she feels insecure about her own relationship with each of them.

In some cases a princess or queen may have some kind of social disability that makes it difficult for her to maintain or pursue an ordinary number of husbands and suitors.

Every queen has an upper limit, of course, for how many drones they can really entertain (there's only so many hours in the day, after all), but it's usually considered gender-nonconforming for a queen to have or be content with only an abnormally small harem (3+ is normal), or for a queen or princess to not have at least *some* interest in other drones. (It's especially common, in fact, for a princess's first drone to actively introduce other drones he likes to her, with the expectation for her to court him to give their own relationship social legitimacy.)

Institutionally-recognised monandrous queenships can sometimes result from death or divorce within an existing queenship, in cases where the loss of too many drones doesn't end up destabilizing the relationship --- society is generally tolerant of their 'mourning heroes' taking it easy in a job that only needs two people, under a sort of ideal about their bonds having been so unbreakable and so irreplaceable that even the survivors would still prefer to continue on with each other.

Broadly though, society considers it somewhat insensitive and insulting when a young princess and drone both interested in monoandry try to act like a complete family or occupy one of those "easy" roles that can be done by only two people, "just because he doesn't want to have to get along with other drones" / "just because she doesn't want to put in the work to recruit" / etc.

### Hyperandry

Most queens have fewer than six drones, but it's not usually considered hyperandry until 10+.

When persistent hyperandry occurs outside of in-universe fiction, it's usually an institutional euphemism for drone homosexuality --- that is, the family includes mostly exclusively-homosexual drones, who benefit from this arrangement legitimizing their relationships with other members of the harem, with a queen who otherwise doesn't have quite as substantive a relationship with those members of her harem.

Depictions of hyperandry are disproportionately common in hivefolk media compared to the actual incidence rate, due to its role in three very common tropes for the species.

Often, it's a comedy trope about a princess who's gotten a little carried away and hasn't learned she can't handle *that* many yet, usually as an ephemeral situation that resolves before her coronation.

Persistent hyperandry, though, can have a propaganda function in legitimizing a lord-empress's rule: usually this involves some legendary lord-empress's large harem of drones from all corners the hiveship showing solidarity, as a less-than-subtle metaphor for the ship as a whole.

The third trope uses persistent hyperandry as part of a particular sort of queer-coded cowardly leader archetype, involving a queen who's not taking the same risks as her drones but continuously courting new suitors to use as cannon fodder.

### Co-Queen

Two princesses who wish to be partners to each other can often choose to be co-queens of the same family. Some cultures almost consider this to be expected of specifically *twin* princesses, and in those cultures it's usually more accepted of non-twin pairs as well.

In cultures that don't formally recognise that type of co-queening union, relationships do still exist but usually form as a result of two queens informally each allowing their husbands to be suitors to the other.

This is still usually the arrangement when this is formalized, even in cultures that allow two princesses to be crowned together as co-queens, but a few 'twin co-queen' cultures allow for a relationship where drones are considered husband to both, rather than each drone being at most husband to one and suitor to the other.

### Trans-Drone

A trans-drone is an anatomically female hivefolk who generally is or wishes to be socially a member of some other queen or princess's harem, in a way distinct from being her co-queen. In general, the social status of drones who aren't in a harem is *much* lower than a princess, and this is usually a transition only undertaken as *part* of joining that harem; a public transition to being a prince-drone is usually much rarer.

This is perhaps the most institutionally-recognised way for an exclusively-homosexual princess to be able to be the partner to a queen without also being partner to a full harem of drones.

Relationships between the members of a queen's harem are common, but they're not the expectation; but it very much is the social expectation that a queen make time for and have intimate relationships with all of her husbands; it's this latter obligation that a trans-drone avoids by becoming a trans-drone rather than co-queen.

A trans-drone may in some cases experience dysphoria over certain sexually dimorphic traits, but at least for some aspects there are fairly readily available options for gender-affirming care.

One of the most straightforward is 'plate trimming', a surgical intervention that involves cutting down a trans-drone's pelvic plate to reduce the overall size and create a simulated forked anellus at the bottom that will make him more drone-presenting. The other most important sex marker around wing coloration and patterning can usually be addressed with either temporary cosmetics or the addition of tattoos to add drone-like patterning.

### Hypergyny

While society generally tolerates drones being suitors to multiple princesses and queens over his life, those relationships are expected to be exclusive one-at-a-time commitments. Most would consider the idea of a drone pursuing multiple princesses or queens concurrently to be just infidelity with extra steps, even if he's neither's husband; or it might be thought of as more an attempt to dodge responsibility for following chain-of-command by playing the two sides off each other or dumping one if he dislikes some order (while still maintaining status as a queen's suitor).

Societies that recognise co-queens often do allow a drone to pursue both co-queens at once, but even then, only rarely can a drone be institutionally recognised as husband to both of them.

### Trans-Queen

A trans-queen is an anatomically male hivefolk whose transition to being socially the queen of some harem of drones. Due to the highly asymmetric sex ratio of this species giving princesses and queens a lot more social power than drones, this type of MtF transition is often viewed extremely dimly by society at large, thought of as only something that disenfranchised drones from the very bottom echelons of society would do to basically create a queen out of another disenfranchised drone to try to boost the status of the trans-queen by being a queen and enfranchise the drones of her harem by their membership in it.

This does sometimes happen for exactly that reason, but by far the most common reason for someone to be a trans-queen is due to having been raised as a trans-princess by parents who didn't wish to incur a surrounding culture's sometimes very one-sided expectations about not raising or treating boys nearly as kindly or as well as girls.

### Xenosexuality

Interspecies sexual attraction is common enough that most cultures don't really consider it "noncomforming" when that attraction amounts to no more than casual one-night stands or fwb relationships between humans and hivefolk.

But, it's still somewhat out of the ordinary for a human to end up queen to a harem of drones, or a permanent member of a queen's harem; or for a hivefolk to end up in a committed monogamous relationship with a human.

And since humans and hivefolk have **no functional interspecies reproductive capability of any kind**, it's especially unusual for a human to take on a social role as a co-parent to children of the other species, even if they are in a committed relationship with a child's parent.

(Regarding hybridization: Some research has gone into the concept of engineering the genome of a child meant to be raised within an interspecies relationship to have traits resembling the non-biological-parent species, but this can only be accomplished via an entirely synthetic procedure: genetic material extracted from one species is entirely incompatible with the other due to them having wholly incompatible gene expression pathways. The usual justification for the handful of very rare and very expensive cases where it has been done is as a means to try to mitigate parental dysphoria, but many cultures don't consider it ethical to tailor a child's genome in a way that can't be justified exclusively based on its benefits to the child rather than their parents.)

A human's anatomical sex or gender presentation is not usually a major factor in what humans a given anthrosexual hivefolk will consider attractive; considerations about sexual anatomy would have some influence to tilt the demographics for longer-term relationships more towards queen-man and drone-woman relationships than vice versa, but this effect is small compared to other factors.

One aspect of human gender norms can massively influence this though is the existence of  gendered clothing norms for certain sorts of flowy or draping clothing that somewhat visually resemble and moves like a hivefolk's wings, i.e. things like skirts, cloaks, capes, ribbons, long hair, or the like.

Non-exclusively-anthrosexual hivefolk of any orientation will almost always have a preference for humans that routinely dress with those sorts of garments and styles.

Non-exclusive anthrosexuality is actually *extremely* common for female princesses, and a princess in an interspecies society is likely to have some significant interest in at least attempting to court humans, though those relationships don't usually survive the princess's transition to queen and the shift in expectations about the partner's level of commitment to fulfilling a drone-gendered role in her harem.

However, it's also common for gender-dysphoric humans to specifically court and join an existing queen's harem, specifically due to the way it provides a socially-accepted transition from their dysphoric gender to an 'drone' hivefolk xenogender.

Exclusive anthrosexuality, in which a hivefolk is *only* attracted to humans and not to other hivefolk, is much rarer, but it's again much more common for princesses than drones. Exclusively-anthrosexual princesses are usually specifically dysphoric over expectations of polyandry, and see the increased tendencies for humans to want an exclusive relationship and to see each other as rivals rather than 'potential harem-mates' as specifically attractive.

Exclusively anthrosexual hivefolk are usually only attracted to either human men *or* human women, but not both. An individual in this situation will often end up transitioning to a human xenogender that would make for a hetero pairing with their desired partner gender.

In the case of a princess xenotrans-woman (the most typical transition for anatomically female hivefolk only interested in human men) there can sometimes be dysphoria over the difficulty in having bursarial sex with human partners (though the fact that she can have ovian sex with them without issue often makes this not as hard of a frustration as it could be without).

Pelvic plates are generally flexible enough to make it just about possible to expose her bursaria to a direct line by pushing it quite hard to one side, but this is often uncomfortable or even painful for both her and her partner (for the man, from pressure from the lateral edge of the plate directly against the side of the shaft of his penis when he's penetrated her).

Gender-affirming care is fairly simple for this in the form of a 'plate splitting' procedure similar to the 'plate trimming' procedure used for trans-drones. Plate-splitting involves cutting the princess' pelvic plate horizontally across at a line just below her bursaria and then re-rooting the removed portion of the plate just below her bursaria as a sort of 'tenth body segment' that still extends down to her perineal area.  With this procedure it's possible for the human male partner to insert his penis from below the new edge of the plate while still preserving her princessly form in a way that doesn't leave her looking more like a drone to hivefolk sensibilities.
