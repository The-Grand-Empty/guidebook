<summary>Design Goals</summary>

  {: .note-title}
  > Design Goals
  > 
  > - Explore unfamiliar 'norms' about society, family, sexuality, and gender, and the ways that members of a society that endorses those norms deviate from them.
  > - Explore a reconstruction and inversion of the "harem" trope.
  > - Allow for characters of this species to be readily sexualizable by a real-world audience.
  > - Explore non-human physiology and its consequences, especially but not exclusively reproductive and sexual physiology.
  > - Avoid excessive resemblance to humans.

  {: .note-title}
  > Terminology Goals
  > 
  > - Be succinct.
  > - Allow for non-technical usage in contexts where technical meanings are not intended.
  > - Avoid aliasing concepts that are meaningfully distinct to the same term.
  > - Be understood by a general audience familiar with terminology used to describe humans.
  > - Represent terminological conflict with an aim to verisimilitude.
  > - Allow for usages that are sensitive to their analogy to real-world gender dysphoria.
  > - Allow for usages that are intentionally hurtful or offensive to in-universe individuals.
