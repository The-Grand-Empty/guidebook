There is no faster-than-light in the Grand Empty.

Advanced propulsion systems that leverage as-yet-undiscovered physical laws _do_ exist, powerful enough to break the exponential term of the rocket equation over their knee. The wake-drive systems that brought the first Earth humans to other stars are one such, and systems in this category may even be colloquially referred to as 'hyperdrives', to distinguish them from the more conventional propulsion systems they are often used in conjunction with. Such systems do allow a ship's crew to take advantage of relativity, and cross the vast emptiness between planets in hours to days, and the empty gulf between stars in weeks to months --- in their _own_ reference frame --- but they are not FTL.

Likewise, for those who care to try, there _are_ methods to transmit data light-years across the Grand Empty. The laser and telescope optics needed to achieve this are not impossible to make, and perhaps some civilization out there has managed to refine this or found a more practical solution that operates on as-yet-undiscovered physical laws --- but even these are not FTL.

As a result, different star systems in The Grand Empty are fundamentally disconnected from each other: spatially, temporally, culturally, economically, lingustically, even technologically. Planets that could theoretically be _made_ habitable are not so rare, but often a star system's nearest inhabited neighbors are 50 light years distant or more.

Certain civilizations _have_ had an outsized impact on their immediate neighborhood, and handful have been prolific enough that their cultural and technological influences can be seen even in far-flung corners of the galaxy; but no galaxy-spanning civilizations exist.

## The Speed of Money
Money is fundamentally non-portable in The Grand Empty. Advanced market economies _do_ exist, with electronic banking, securities exchanges, derivatives markets, and every other monetary fiction under the sun.

On interstellar scales, though, and in the face of relativity, money fundamentally fails at its job.

- basics
  - economy size: anywhere resources cheaper to bring than make
  - money supply: currency in active circulation
  - money/supply = value/economy (small-angle approximation)
  - opportunity costs create a finite time horizon
  - relativistic interest spread
  - regime-change market corrections
- immigration
  - remote currency's value diminished by transport cost
  - interstellar: 0% exchange rate
    - past time horizon on opportunity cost
    - transport cost > goods value
- emigration
  - dormant balance removes money from money supply
  - deflation redistributes value
  - dormant ownership: implicit taxation just like minting if exercised
  - planets reject returning owner's claims
- space costs everything you have

## Interstellar Trade Ships
### Construction
  - capital construction costs cannot amortize in a stationary reference frame
  - enforcement of property is impossible at interstellar range
  - construction usually funded with some amount of securities fraud
  - most civs don't ever build more than a few ships
### Trade
- high-risk high-reward arbitrage mispredictions
  - information effective age is at least 2x distance
  - unpredictable tech development, regime changes, etc
  - out of supples and no cargo of value: bankruptcy
    - reorganize, fund ship from retiree berths
  - out of supplies and nobody to trade: foundering
    - settle, hope you like gravity wells and dirt
- goods and services
  - sometimes, companies exist for foreign liaison
  - tech: medicine, machinery, microprocessors
  - software: Windows XP Y10K rollover bugs
  - media: piracy by default
  - exotic items: kimian magic?
  - berths: space costs everything you have

## Colony Ships
- cryptosleep tech sometimes available
### Exploration vs Terraforming
- ultra-long-term terraforming trusts, generational securities
- 'bare rock' to 'just about survivable' still takes hundreds of years
- or, exoplanet surveys for oxygen biospheres
- independent same-planet neighboring colonies are common
### Construction
- ticket classes
- berths: space costs everything you have
### Colonization
- generational crew vs cryptosleeper conflict in transit
- generational crew will be spacers by the time they arrive
- designated inheritance: sky vs ground
- strong cultural identity, duty
- colony-ship AI systems
