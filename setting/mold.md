> All I can say is that everyone's instant impression of the smell was that of spent gunpowder, not that it was 'metallic' or 'acrid'. Spent gunpowder smell probably was much more implanted in our memories than other comparable odors.

When Apollo 11 touched down on the moon, three-and-a-half years after the soviets had landed their unmanned Luna 9, few knew what to expect from its surface. The Americans had landed their own Surveyor probes, and with this the Apollo mission planners were satisfied that such a task was possible: that there was a stable surface one could land on, and not sink endlessly into the seas of dust suggested by the results of the Luna 2 and Ranger 7-9 impact missions.

But when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin climbed back into their Eagle ascent stage and removed their helmets as the first earth humans in their epoch to set foot on another body, they also became the first to describe contact with extraterrestrial life.

# Mold

**Space mold**, also sometimes referred to as **lunar mold** or **moon dust**, refers to the vacuum-adapted extraterrestrial microorganisms from the genus _Regolithicus_. The type species, _Regolithicus lunus_, resembles finely-pulverized grains of basalt, and the first known descriptions of the species in Earth's historical record come from the Apollo missions.

## Life Cycle
Most members of _Regolithicus_ are obligate anhydrobes, and many require vacuum conditions to survive. Spores can be found free-floating among other forms of dust on many common orbital trajectories, and will electrostatically attract to and attach themselves to almost surface they come in proximity of.

Once a spore has attached itself to a meteorite or vessel, it transitions to a more active metabolism as it searches for a suitably-protected nook or cranny with access to food. _Regolithica_ are capable of migrating across most metallic and dielectric surfaces, with some species observed moving as quickly as 3 feet per day. Most species seem to follow thermal gradients, but some have been shown to also respond to patterns of light and darkness as their host body rotates to find shade, and still others have been observed magnetic fields to locate microscopic hairline cracks in metal surfaces.

_Regolithicus_ are metallotrophic and reproduce by fragmentation. Once an individual has found and entered a suitable crack or pore, they will digest and convert any exposed source of metal into increased body size, and apply intense mechanical pressure against the edges of their substrate order to fragment itself into multiple offspring.

Once a _Regolithicus_ colony has expanded to fill its crack or pore, individuals at the surfaces of the substrate will continue to expand and build pressure, while those further from the substrate revert into spores. This pressure continues to build and wedges the crack wider to create more room for growth.

Wild _Regolithicus_ specialized in colonizing naturally-occurring asteroids will at this stage also begin evolving pressurized gas pockets, which burst to propel the colony's spores into an orbital dust cloud; however, many species have evolved behavioral adaptations specific to artificial structures.

_Regolithicus acus_ is known for colonizing deep pores through its substrate to create pinhole leaks in pressurized gas tanks and compartments, which it uses to propel a steady stream of spores; while _Regolithicus scissura_ is best known for inducing catastrophic structural failures to spread its spores using the resulting explosive decompression.

## Health and Safety
Space mold poses major health and safety risks to those who encounter it. Exposed textiles degrade rapidly as grains cling to and migrate into their weave. When removing a suit after exposure, special care is required to avoid skin contact; of secondary concern is to ensure the spores don't spread to the airlock's equipment or the ship's interior, with regular filter changes and special quarantine and sterilization procedures.

Space mold clings readily to skin, and will often migrate rapidly into spaces that resemble their natural environment, such as a patient's ears, fingernails, and hair follicles, resulting in severe rashes and dermal abrasion if not addressed.

Space molds are rapidly destroyed by exposure to liquid water, so they are not able to survive entering a patient's nostrils, mouth, lungs, or genitals; however, most species break down into water-soluble chemicals that are at least mildly toxic to humans, including substances with acute neurological effects.

Any indication of exposure should be treated immediately by with a complete full-body shower or bath in free-flowing liquid water. Contaminated waste-water must be distilled before it can be reused. Patients showing any substantial spore migration or exhibiting neurological symptoms should be treated for heavy metal exposure and monitored for electrolyte imbalances. 

## Economic Impact
Within the Earth planetary system, losses attributable to space molds across all industries were estimated to exceed 10 trillion dollars in the year 3440.
Several notable accidents in Earth's history are attributed to encounters with _R. scissura_ and similar species, most notably the Suji-Kag Beak Disaster, and it's even speculated that a similar encounter may have contributed to the mission failure of Apollo 13.

Each of the Earth system's planetary governments maintains strict quarantine requirements for any vessel with any sign of mold, with the governing coalitions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune routinely scuttling and de-orbit afflicted vessels into their gas giant to prevent their spread.

Visiting interstellar craft are subject to rigorous inspections to certify that they are mold-free before they are allowed to enter high-traffic orbital planes or dock with trading partners.

Some species of space mold have their own commercial uses, however. The comparatively-docile _R. lunus_ that blanket the surface of Earth's and many other moons is an essential natural resource that can be refined as a source of rare metals. Certain species are essential for the production of certain pharmaceuticals. Some esoteric faith groups intentionally expose themselves to certain specific strains for their neurological effects, as part of their beliefs.

## Countermeasures
Even standard EVA suits are built to resist abrasion, and if in good repair can be expected to withstand space mold for a handful of hours before losing pressure. Specialized suits do exist, with mold-repellant treatments that prevent the mold from attaching, but expect to trade off cost, weight, and other forms of protection.

Ships are usually clad smooth or and painted with specialty coating systems to (a) reduce how effectively the mold can attach, and (b) prevent the mold from finding cracks it can migrate into to cause damage. However, maintaining a perfectly smooth defect-free surface in the face of micrometeorite damage requires ongoing maintenance and expense. Spaceship coating systems often include additives that can neutralize a small amount of mold when they're applied over top, to prevent any spores delivered by a micrometeorite chip from causing damage once they're painted over; but this assumes that the crew notices and repairs micrometeorite chips quickly.

Growing cracks of mold can often be dealt with by spraying them with liquid water, usually thinned with ethanol or another solvent to help penetrate the cracks. Water is a valuable resource, though, and while some of it will freeze and can be chipped off and recovered, the water lost to sublimation can be a substantial expense. To the ~~criminally negligent~~ profit-minded, it can sometimes be tempting to just paint over and ignore, though.

Some ships include more active countermeasures, such as impressed magnetic field systems designed to draw mold towards specifically designed 'traps' on their surface that can be cleaned or replaced. Airlocks often include sensors, filters, and decontamination showers designed to detect and deal with mold before it can be introduced into the ship's interior. General ship life support usually also includes systems capable of filtering and detecting airborne mold, but by the time spores are getting trapped in that filter it's usually too late to save the ship, even if you might be able to get it to hold together a _bit_ longer.
