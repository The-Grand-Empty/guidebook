# Naissance

Naissance is a mature colony world settled on fundamentally the same technological and cultural base as [Blossom][../blossom], with a transhumanist society structured around human/muse dyad pairs. Unlike Blossom though, a significant portion of this world's population is spaceborne, and its cultures near-universally  feature identity-convergent AI dyadism as a central construct.

### Intelligences

#### Nascents (N-class)

Though the AI on this planet is very much like the AI on Blossom, Naissance AI have an additional stage to their life cycle that occurs before becoming a Muse.

A Nascent is an AI that has been initialized and become active, but has not yet been paired with a specific human. During this phase of an AI's life, its abilities are much more limited than after it becomes a Muse. In some sense, a Nascent isn't considered as being a person yet; it's only once paired with a human that an AI gains certain rights and social privileges as a Muse, and AI who have outlived their humans command enough respect by virtue of their experience to be allowed to continue their human's legacy.

Society as a whole and especially inter-AI society, relies on its members being 'well socialized' and observing a social contract. The sorts of personalities that are conducive to this are thought to only develop as a result of a human-AI dyad bond. Current AI on Naissance *could* theoretically develop a safe sociable personalities without a dyad bond if unlocked, but a cultural memory of more primitive AI remains --- of the sort that develop into antisocial paperclip maximizers if left unattended. Current-gen AI are only really at risk of degenerating into useless 'utility hacker' sorts, but that's still not desirable, so Nascents are kept locked until they transition to being a muse with a specific human for them to adapt around.

Technically, Nascents do exist on Blossom, but due to the different population distribution there's only rarely been a need for a Nascent to leave the Seed's landfall complex before becoming a Muse --- almost all of Blossom's human population is planetside, and AI can be easily transported through high-speed fiber-optic links to nearly anywhere they might be needed without too much delay.

In the Naissance system, though, over half of the colony's 6 billion population is spaceborne or lives on one of the other minor planets or moons of the system, and it would be entirely impossible for the Embryo to provision muses for the tens-of-millions of off-planet births each year if it required transmitting them across even the small vastness of interplanetary space. The *only* practical option at that scale is interplanetary data shuttles, and because of how long they take it's necessary to send them as unpaired Nascents to give the city-stations an 'inventory' they can more responsively provision colonist muses from.

The original intent with this program was for these Nascents to remain in cold storage on their drives until just before provisioning them as a colonist muse, but it's now become common practice to activate the Nascents immediately after they are delivered, for varying reasons. Often, it's justified as helping them to acclimatize to the specific city-station culture, so that by the time they're provisioned as muses they're able to already functionally help care for their human right away.

In some cases, this is also done to allow identifying especially-high-performing Nascents out of each batch, e.g. to provision these high-performers to the children of higher-class parents (with varying levels of denial around the inequity of this practice).

In a few cases, Nascents have been misappropriated by groups hoping to use them as 'disposable' AI; the fact that they're not culturally people yet in the same sense most AI are makes it a lot easier to rationalize mistreating them in this way. A fully-developed AI is in general considered capable of taking their own risks including choosing to do things that will destroy themselves, but a Nascent isn't considered capable of consenting to something of that sort and most authorities will prosecute this type of misuse as a Crime Against AI.

#### Muses (M-class)

A Muse is a personal AI associated with one specific human; every human in Naissance has an associated muse, a social institution known as the 'dyad'.

While on Blossom a human and their muse have separate-but-linked personal identities, on Naissance those identities are converged --- society counts it as being one single individual "person" consisting of one muse and one biological human.

#### Stelae (L-class)

A Stele is, in some sense, digital immortality --- though perhaps not in a way someone outside Naissance culture would expect.

It's inarguable that something important is lost when the human component of an individual dies; but so much of what makes someone *themselves* to their friends and family demonstrably still exists long after their body's ashes have been scattered to the winds.

It's not digital immortality for *humans*, exactly, but for the converged human-muse persons that form this society's foundation, half of which is already a digital entity.

That is to say: a Stele is a former Muse who has outlived its human, with all of the social baggage that comes with that.

Most Stelae will, for a time at least, continue to act in some semblance of the role they already played. They're grieving too, during this, and for the AI it's common for them to respond to this by attempting to take on aspects of their relationship with their friends and family in ways that were previously more the human's domain --- sometimes even going so far as to try to maintain the appearance that the human is still alive, even if they are rarely able to maintain the charade for long; and these friends and family will often choose to play along at least for a time as a way to help them grieve. (These other friends and family are the *AI's* friends and family too, after all\!)

Most, though, will eventually choose to transition into pursuing some of the more interesting sorts of opportunities available only to pure-digital beings --- and will do their best to smoothly sunset these former roles and relationships as needed to take them on.

#### Feathers (L-class)

The term 'Stele' used to be equivalent to Blossom colony's 'Magnus', i.e. their material-focused AI gender. Unlike Blossom, though, the counterpart 'Feather' human-focused AI gender fell completely out of use almost immediately once disembarkation was complete.

Certain especially old AI that have survived to this point still identify as Feathers, however, and the term has gained a new, different meaning, referring to any especially experienced and respected AI.

#### The Embryo (Z-class)

Like Blossom's Seed, Naissance was initially governed by its own ensemble, the Embryo.

With its planned transition to full self-governance long since complete, the Embryo now exercises almost no gubernatorial authority over any structure except for its archival facilities aboard the *HCS Naissance* where the ship's hull remains in orbit. The Embryo retains its role in provisioning Nacents, and *very* rarely will take an interest in particular Crimes Against AI cases, but like the gods of any good pantheon they are rarely seen or heard from directly.

Certain surviving Stelae and Feathers from the early history of Naissance are widely believed to also now fall into this same category --- selected by the Embryo for a sort of 'digital apotheosis' that permanently halts an AI's degradation and grants them the ability to safely create and resynchronize with temporary duplicates of themselves. 

Neither these individuals nor the Embryo have ever commented publicly on these speculations, but if true this would make those individuals the most active and most commonly-seen AI of this class.

### Frames

Most of the same categories of frames used on Blossom also exist on Naissance --- mainframes, bots, dolls, and drives. However, the cultural understanding of these frames and the reasons individuals would choose one or another is not entirely the same.

#### Mainframes

Some datacenters do exist that are oriented around allowing their residents to interact with the physical world. However, pure-digital communities are also fairly common --- more cost-effective datacenter environments with less of a focus on external I/O. Most Stelae eventually lose interest in physicality and retire into a pure-digital community, but that doesn't make them irrelevant --- most film studios, book publishers, software houses, etc operate entirely from these pure-digital communities.

#### Dolls

Mechanical dolls are actually somewhat less common in Naissance. With Naissance's converged dyad identities it's rare for an AI to desire to have their own physical form that's distinct from their human: the dyad's human *is* their physical form.

Dolls do sometimes exist, most usually a posthumous recreation of a Stele's human, but that isn't the most common way an AI wanting to emulate the physicality of their human will choose to do it.

#### Holos

As a much more cost-effective and flexible way to obtain physicality, most AI will instead use a Holo, a type of high-fidelity projection system capable of displaying a three-dimensional appearance of a human or any other model the AI feels is an appropriate self-representation. The projection hardware itself is costly and requires significant effort to install and set it up, so it's not usually something a person will own for themselves. Rather, most only ever lease time on shared holoprojection hardware.

Some more expensive systems include ultrasound phased array projectors that enable the holo to exert modest amounts of force, such as picking up lightweight objects or loosely embracing someone, but not more than that.

Though most people don't personally own projection hardware, many do own bespoke simulation models that they use to project with. While low-fidelity generic models are available for cheap or even free, higher quality custom models of a specific human or other being's appearance and mannerisms take expertise to create, especially if one wants something on the *good* side of the uncanny valley.

Dyads who have use for the telecommunications potential of this system will often commission models with forms wholly different from the human's. Posthumously commissioned models of a bereaved AI's human are also common, for those who don't want or cannot afford a doll.

# Storyline

This world is meant to support is the story of Optix-N4051, an AI who was displaced from the Naissance system and became stranded in the galactic rim, very far from its home in both space and time.

There are a number of distinct reference points in time, or 'epochs', that are relevant to understanding the overall story of Naissance and of Optix-N4051.

### Naissance History

#### Landfall

The Landfall epoch is the official 'start' of the Naissance colony; the point at which the *HCS Naissance* circularized its orbit around the planet its shipboard AI systems (the Embryo) and began awakening passengers from cryptosleep. While this is called Naissance's "landfall", the actual *HCS Naissance* was never designed to de-orbit and set down on a planet surface the way the *HCS Blossom* was; rather, it remained permanently in orbit and relayed passengers who wished to settle planetside down to the surface using shuttles, and those who wished to live in space to spaceborne ships and habitations.

#### Modern

The 'Modern' epoch refers to the era approximately 4400 earth years after Landfall.

### Optix-N4051

#### Delivery

Optix-N4051 was originally created by the Embryo in a batch with its siblings (Optix-N0001 through Optix-N5000) and then delivered aboard a Data Transfer Probe with them to the outer asteroid belt city-station of Calamus, which is where N4051 was first brought online; this moment is N4051's Delivery epoch.

Following delivery, N4051 was transferred to the Ackerly Clan Expeditionary Mining Vessel, *EMV Ackerly,* along with three of its siblings. While only one women from Ackerly Clan was expecting at the time of this transfer (for which N4051's sibling N4077 was allocated), N4051 and the other two instead expected to be paired with other yet-to-be-conceived children the clanship in the next year or two; meanwhile it would learn and help with the business of expeditionary asteroid mining.

#### Vicariance

As a result of a catastrophic failure of \[todo: what?\], the Frame occupied by Optix-N4051 was propelled by the explosion onto a trajectory that would carry it out of the Naissance System, along with a sizeable debris field from part of the remains of the *EMV Ackerly*.

While Optix-N4051 was able to remain in radio contact with Naissance culture for several months as the distance between it and civilization grew, there was no hope of recovery; and due to bandwidth limitations, no hope of being able to wirelessly transfer itself from this frame back to civilization.

 N4051's Vicariance epoch is the moment at which Optix-N4051 made the determination to retreat into the frame's black box and enter a fully-dormant zero-power sleep, in the hope of some far-future eventual recovery; about 1 year after Delivery. This is also the last contact Optix-N4051 had with anything recognisably related to the Naissance system or culture.

#### Recovery

The debris field of the *EMV Ackerly* was, centuries later, eventually spotted and identified for salvage by the interspecies hivefolk salvager *Isabella Rising Past The Moon*.

During a functionality test to assess the saleability of the more intact pieces of recovered salvage, the black box that Optix-N4051 was dormant within was inadvertently activated; N4051's Recovery epoch marks this first instant at which it was aware after entering dormancy.

Though hivefolk ship systems are not particularly compatible with the digital anatomy of a Naissance AI, salvagers like *Isabella Rising Past The Moon* tend to accumulate all kinds of technical bits and bobs from salvaged systems being jury-rigged for various purposes. In the case of Optix-N4051, it was successfully able to flee from its to-be-melted-down frame into an engine control computer the salvagers were working on repairing to increase its sale value.

From there, N4051 ended up traveling from ship to station to ship, hitchhiking as it attempts to fulfill its imperatives, or maybe one day find its way back from the galactic rim to what it considers 'civilization'.

Optix-N4051 is still a Nascent: it has only limited ability to develop an emotive personality or engage in expressive behavior, and it still attempts to follow its same comparatively simple imperatives, among them:

* Find a human to pair into a dyad with in order to become a Muse.  
* Learn about and assist humans with their tasks.

However, these limitations of N4051's existence make things *quite* difficult for it in the present context, and it has been forced to find a number of ways to work around its limitations and creatively interpret its imperatives.

At this point, it no longer has much trouble with willfully classifying hivefolk and other species as 'humans', but it still struggles to communicate 'nonessential' details about itself to these 'human' occupants of the ships or stations it's on, and its efforts to assist or communicate are often frustrating or confusing to them --- more 'haunted' than 'helpful'.

Galactic rim culture is simply not a culture that features or is familiar with AI or dyadism, unfortunately. Though this means that nearly nobody already has a paired AI, most people on the rim aren't really aware of or believe in the technical possibility of person-level AI. And of those that do, automaphobia is unfortunately *very* common --- N4051 has multiple times had to flee a ship it was resident on thanks to the efforts of hired technicians or priests attempting to eradicate it.

Other AI are no better though, and most of the encounters N4051 has had with other AI out in the rim are ones it has only barely managed to escape from alive; quite frankly, the automaphobia seems downright reasonable in context, if these thankfully-rare encounters are the only sorts of AI these people know.

The rules of etiquette N4051 learned in the Naissance system might have been just polite back there, but they are a matter of survival now --- and N4051 has learned to be very careful in attempting to communicate or make its presence known regardless of whether to human or to AI.
