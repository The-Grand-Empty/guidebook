The transhuman colonies derive from some of Earth's earliest efforts and ambitions to establish earth-equivalent peer civilizations around other stars. Such colony projects, settled on the back of generational effort rather than any relativistic shortcut, always require some level of cultural engineering in order to succeed, leading to frontier worlds with distinctly transhuman-feeling societies.

[Blossom](./blossom) is a fairly young colony world still in the process of settling its frontier. As a setting it explores ideas about the role of AI in community and the divide between rural and urban class structure.

[Naissance](./naissance) is an older, far more mature colony, settled on some of the same premise as Blossom. As a setting, it develops the same ideas to further depths to build a concept of digital immortality --- one that only works in the face of radical personal identity concepts that the AI enable.

[Saleen](./saleen) is a third such colony: settled on a planet with native sophonts, and giving rise to colonialism and related conflicts. As a setting, it explores how access-to-technology can affect perceptions of personhood and be used to justify exploitation, and presents a take on the story of [Sanhedrin 75a:2](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.75a.2) that pits AI personhood and capacity to consent against a planet-scale humanitarian colonial crisis.

[Epra](./epra) is a colonization effort still in progress, with terraforming efforts well underway, ships to bring its colonists still bunder construction, and a society embroiled in conflicts over _who_ the new world is for and how efforts to organize its colony mission ought to balance a whole society's worth of conflicting interests.
