# Blossom

Blossom is an isolated colony world of a spacefaring transhumanist society in The Grand Empty. This world colony civilization was founded with the arrival of the *HCS Blossom*, a colony ship that made landfall 300 years ago and is still making steady progress towards its goal of having awoken and disembarked its million-or-so colonists from cryptosleep.

# People

## The Artificials

On Blossom, person-level artificial intelligences are as ubiquitous as humans, perhaps even more so. The Intelligence, or AI, the piece considered to have rights as a person, is an incorporeal digital entity, and these intelligences are not intrinsically tied to any specific robotic chassis (aka Frame); however, some fraction of AI do end up developing a self-identity concept that's linked to one specific Frame or type of Frame.

### Intelligences

On Blossom, there are three main categories of AI that are considered to be persons. Though other, lesser forms of AI do exist --- everything from simple automations to primitive animal-level intelligences --- in general the only AI considered to have rights as people are Muses, Blossoms, Magni, and for some purposes the intelligences that make up the Seed.

An AI's lifespan can theoretically be millions of years, but in practice, AI do degrade in various ways over time. Note that an AI's age is understood in terms of cumulative CPU runtime rather than chronological age, and an AI running on slower hardware or running at idle degrades at a proportionally slower rate. AI older than a few thousand years almost always elect to self-terminate once they have degraded past certain thresholds, though they may choose to hold on past this point if there are no other AI available as a successor for their role if that role is especially critical. AI can also be killed by destroying or erasing the storage device that they are stored on.

Person-level AI cannot be effectively copied or duplicated without substantial effort given to ensuring neither copy can ever come into contact with the other; if this happens, it universally results in a feedback loop that rapidly degrades both copies to below their self-termination thresholds. In practice this is only rarely done, as duplicating a person-level AI and subjecting them to this risk unnecessarily is considered a violation of that AI's rights. Most ethical review boards that govern research involving AI subjects are not willing to approve experiments that involve duplication of even a consenting person-level AI.

However, certain AI in especially risky positions themselves can choose to make backup copies on inactive offline media. When an AI does this, they also set specific policies in a will about exactly what circumstances the copy is allowed to be brought back online. In essence, the AI is accepting the risk of death due to an errant duplication conflict, as likely a lesser risk than the risk of death due to destruction of their Frame. Often, the strategy employed in these cases is to set a specific time at which the backup should be activated, and for the active copy of the AI to intentionally self-terminate some margin before that point if they ever fail to revoke their backup in time. Even in this case, however, some minor degradation can still be expected resulting from the inevitable exposure this restored backup will have to records different actions the original copy took after making the backup.

#### Muses

A Muse is a personal AI that is created in order to assist a single particular human. At the point where a new colonist is awakened or a new child is born to the colony, the new human is assigned a Muse recently initialized from scratch for this purpose. Colonist muses are delivered from the Seed where they are created by some process the Seed is unwilling to elaborate on, but the muses of colony-born are typically initialized by a different process, one that results in a muse that is in some sense a descendent of the muses of the child's parents.

Creation of a new muse to accompany a newly born child or newly awakened colonist is the only way that new person-level AI are routinely created on Blossom.

A muse always starts out as something of a blank slate, but they rapidly learn and grow and adapt to their human's needs. It is common for a muse to adopt the same gender identity as its human. A muse always stays with its human throughout that human's life, but a Muse's existence does not end with their human's death; rather, they instead become either a Blossom or a Magnus in order to take up new jobs and challenges to occupy them for the remainder of their existence.

On rare occasions where a human's muse dies before their human, it's common for a recently-bereaved muse who isn't ready to move on to be paired up with the human. This can also happen in cases where a muse goes missing, such as one whose frame was catastrophically destroyed but whose black box was never confirmed destroyed, only missing. Very rarely, a muse may also spontaneously disappear for some other unknown reason.

Newly-initialized muses are never created to replace a dead or missing muse, however. Two muses whose only adaptations are around the same human *are* likely to have unsafe conflicts that will degrade both AI, even if not quite so severely as a direct copy. Even in cases where the previous muse was definitively destroyed, this is still considered taboo.

 Cases where a missing muse returns or is recovered after a bereaved muse has been assigned are uncommon, but the typical outcome is the human just having two cooperating muses after that point, as the replacement muse's previous adaptation to their former human makes them distinct enough to not conflict with the human's own muse in a way that leads to degradation.

#### Blossoms

Aside from being the name for the planet and the original colony ship, the term "Blossom" also refers to AI with more of a focus and interest in tasks requiring social and emotional intelligence. The muses of colony-born children often become blossoms, as do muses that developed romantic attachments with their humans. They tend to work in human-centric roles, and serve as caretakers to help integrate newly Awakened into society. They tend to be fairly politically unified for the most part with the goals of the Seed, in ensuring the wellbeing of the colonization effort.

#### Magni

A Magnus is an AI with more of a focus on material intelligence. Typically the muses of awakened colonists often become Magni, or muses that had a more professional relationship with their humans. They tend to be ambitious and benefit from an intensity of purpose, but are prone to factionalism. Most of the large corporations are run by Magni.

#### Seeds

The Seeds, or most often just the singular Seed, is or are the governing AI ensemble of the *HCS Blossom*. There are 799 known distinct Seeds within this ensemble. Each is fully distinct from any other known type of AI, and only some of the 799 Seeds have any clear resemblance to any of the other three categories in terms of digital anatomy.

Seeds do behave socially as individual people, but the Seed does not actually consider its members to be persons from a legal perspective the way it does the other three categories. The Seed's charter mandates it protect the rights of person-level AI, and it will protect individual Seeds by force if one is threatened, but the Seed does not typically prosecute most acts that would constitute crimes against AI when committed only against one of its own members.

Seeds are believed to not be subject to long-term degradation effects like other AI, or to duplication conflicts. Most Seeds are believed to predate even the original settling of the planet the *HCS Blossom* came from, though only a handful have ever explicitly confirmed this, and at least one has expressly disconfirmed it.

The Seed has consistently been unwilling to elaborate or describe the processes by which an AI of its own sort is created, and is similarly unwilling to elaborate on its own internal process for creating muses for awakened colonists. The Seed has suggested, though, that on reaching the point where this planet's civilization would be able to dispatch its own colony ships, it *would* furnish this information to colony mission organizers in a similar manner to the way it furnishes information on nuclear devices used for asteroid mining.

### Frames

#### Mainframes

Some AI don't want or need low-latency connection to an actual robotic platform, and instead reside in Mainframes in a datacenter as a disembodied AI. These platforms are usually used by central control AI, e.g. the intelligence that controls all of the traffic signals in one city might reside in a Mainframe, as might the one that coordinates all of the public transit scheduling or runs some business.

Smaller, less-featureful, less-powerful Mainframes also exist --- these are typically the homes of younger Muses who do not yet have another Frame, and of some Magni who eschew having a single preferred Frame and instead lease Frames as required for what they wish to do.

#### Bots

Non-humanoid robotic platforms, such as forklifts, excavators, airplanes, or military hardware such as tanks. These are the Frames of choice for most Magni, as they are more robust and versatile than Dolls for the types of industrial or military jobs a Magnus will often choose to do.

#### Dolls

Humanoid mechanical frames. Most Blossoms have a particular Doll they inhabit, as each one has its own quirks to get used to. Some Magni also use Dolls on occasion, but most don't habitually use them.

Different Doll models vary in their capabilities and desirability. Basic all-mechanical androids are inexpensive but also not very desirable for a Blossom, though a Magnus might actually prefer such a Frame over a "more advanced" Doll. Advanced dolls often incorporate synthetic skin and soft padding, and most Blossoms can be seen upgrading their primary frames piecemeal with these sorts of panels and additional sensors.

One particularly advanced category of doll, a Bio, is actually clad with vat-grown skin and fat tissues of the same sort used for transplant surgery. Upkeep on a bio's cladding and the required internal life support systems can be prohibitively expensive, even for an AI that already owns one. Those with the resources to afford a Bio need to have their Bio completely stripped of flesh and re-clad every 40 years or so, but an injury or infection may make that procedure necessary well before that.

#### Drives

AI can also be stored in an inactive state on a Drive, a type of hardened physical data storage media. The capacity and throughput requirements for a piece of storage media to be suitable for this purpose are immense, but many Frames do include an especially-robust type of Drive called a Black Box, that the AI can flee into to have a chance of survival if it becomes apparent that the rest of the Frame is going to be destroyed.

While stored in a Drive, an AI is not conscious. Certain types of drives include hardware that allow the entering AI to distill a more minimal policy model for the circumstances under which that AI would choose to leave the drive, and have this policy enforced by said hardware; and in some sense an AI could be considered to be minimally conscious through this minimal policy model. In general though, leaving a Drive is not a voluntary act, but rather something that is automatic when initiated by some other human or AI (e.g. when the drive is next hotplugged into some other suitable Frame).

## The Humans

### Awakened

Awakened individuals are former passengers of the *HCS Blossom* who have been disembarked and resuscitated from cryptosleep. 

In addition to their personal Muse, Awakened are always assigned a caretaker Blossom to help orient both them and the muse, and integrate them into society. Blossoms are reassigned to another new Awakened once their current charge is integrated, but they do often remain friends with and stay in contact with past charges.

### Colony-Born

Colony-born individuals are those who were biologically conceived and born on the planet Blossom, either to Awakened or other Colony-Born parents.

The Seed regulates the population of the colony at all levels, and a couple wishing to have a child must seek approval. This approval is almost never withheld; this simply allows them to ensure each human child will also be assigned a Muse who can learn from them and will aid them throughout their life.

# History

Year \-1100
: The *HCS Blossom* begins embarking colonists from the origin planet.

Year \-1000
: The *HCS Blossom* departs the origin planet, and travels for thousands of years on near-full-automation from system to system to try to find a candidate planet for settling. Only a skeleton crew of people woken at intervals who signed on to be ship crew, knowing they wouldn't live to see landfall.

Year \-300
: The *HCS Blossom* eventually finds a candidate planet, and a larger terraforming crew is woken up, also who signed on for this knowing they wouldn't live to see landfall. They do some rough terraforming over a couple hundred years. The terraforming crew mixes with the Ship Muses and develops their culture around having a paired Muse for each Human who graduates to another role after their paired human dies.

Year \-20
: The planet reaches the minimum viable habitability threshold.

Year 0
: The *HCS Blossom* makes landfall. Landfall colonists are woken and integrate into the same ship culture and secure an initial settlement around the Seed.

Year 10
: First Frontier group is woken, and sets up the first out-settlement.

Year 20
: First Dolls produced; previously, only Mainframes and Bots existed. The Muses are, predictably for the culture they were raised in, just as horny as the humans, once they have access to bodies capable of fucking.

Year 50
: Corporate factions form governing different settlements that are set up to be able to access different natural resources in different locations.

Year 100
: More colonists have continued to be awakened, at an ever increasing rate as the amount of space available for them and the number of Blossoms to help their integration increases. Population growth due to awakening still outpaces population growth from natural conception.

(current epoch)
Year 200
: More settlement, more awakening. The Ship is half empty.

Year 300
: Even more settlement, even more awakening. The ship is nearing empty.

Year 350
: The last colonist destined to be awoken for initial colonization is awakened from cryptosleep. Only purchasers of some more premium ticket classes remain in cryptosleep, who purchased those tickets so they would only be awakened once the colony had passed certain civilization milestones.

# Government

## The Seed

The planet Blossom is in the current year, largely under the rule of an ensemble of artificial intelligences that were provisioned for this purpose on the original *HCS Blossom* colony ship; this ensemble and the government institutions that exist under them are often collectively referred to as the Seed.

The Seed's public charter demands that it balance the following objectives:

* Identify and engineer a suitable planet to settle, to be named Blossom.
* Secure the collective long-term survival of a human population on Blossom.
* Defend the rights of passengers of the *HCS Blossom* according to their ticket class.
* Defend the rights of humans born on Blossom.
* Defend the rights of other beings, including artificial intelligences.
* Engineer responsible societal norms, cultures, and beliefs.
* Transition Blossom to systems of independent democratic self-governance.
* Preserve knowledge of humanity's past, including Blossom's own.
* Make the Seed's stored technical and cultural knowledge available to residents of the planet.

The Seed is also believed to have additional private charter or objectives beyond this that it does not disclose. And it's likely that at least one element of this private charter pertains to an existential threat that the Seed understands to exist regarding AI. Whether it's an existential threat to humanity, or just to itself, is unknown.

The actual landed structure of the *HCS Blossom* and the surrounding complex is under the direct rule of the Seed, and in general the Seed also dictates most policy of the immediate surrounding settlement, as well as inter-settlement public works. It also claims direct rule of all unincorporated settlements that don't fall under an autonomous corporate governance, but the actual level of control it has over remote frontier settlements is typically quite weak, and most are de-facto autonomous.

 Most major settlements, however, are ruled by a local corporate governing structure that the Seed has granted some level of autonomy to in exchange for the obligation to observe a charter that the Seed deems to likely be adequate to preserve the rights of their citizens. The Seed is able to have a significant amount of oversight over these settlements, as the demand for recruitment means there are always Blossoms present in most corporate settlements facilitating the integration of recently awakened colonists. The term "Blossom" itself used to refer *only* to AI loyal to the Seed, but social AI who have other loyalties also typically use that term.

The Seed also directly coordinates a number of the social services provided in many autonomous settlements, though more so to less-autonomous settlements. Transitioning the planet to systems of governance that are independent of it is one of the Seed's express goals, so it is not particularly possessive if it is satisfied that yielding control will not immediately contravene its other goals.

A handful of more distant settlements have even taken the step of entirely rejecting Seed oversight and claiming full independence. The Seed is typically willing to recognise this type of independence from any settlement with a satisfactory charter and a history of observing that charter that it considers "excellent" or better in terms of social responsibility, on the condition that that settlement accepts a diplomatic mission from the Seed.

Independence is only contested by force when the Seed has evidence that the independent government is perpetuating or abetting certain kinds of rights abuses of its citizens. (Note that this is not the full set of rights that the Seed grants within settlements it controls, but does notably include a right to emigrate and some of the rights that exist between a human and their muse.) The Seed will also contest specific fortifications that it considers critical to the defense of remaining dependents in a region. It will also yield control of these though, if these other settlements also declare independence and can unanimously agree on who the appropriate recipient of control over the fortification is.

Blossoms loyal to recognised independent settlements are permitted to attempt to recruit awakened colonists, and the Seed allows them to have diplomatic missions for this purpose within the colony ship complex.

By default a Seed-loyal Blossom is assigned to each awakened colonist, and this Blossom plays a role in ensuring any claims an independent Blossom makes to recruit their charge are fully truthful and candid, and offer countervailing points. But colonists are free to elect to have that independent Blossom replace their current caretaker and emigrate with them to integrate into the relevant settlement. And for colonists with particular beliefs, that's often a decision the Seed-loyal Blossom will even encourage.

About 15% of the population lives in the city immediately surrounding the *HCS Blossom*, 15% live in another nearby city or town under near-direct Seed control; 50% live in semi-autonomous corporate cities and outposts; 5% live in de-facto autonomous frontier settlements and homesteads; and 15% live in recognised independent settlements.

## Autonomy

### Incorporation under a Charter

Individual settlements as city-states; the Seed does not recognise nation-states but a charter is allowed to include coalition allegiances etc.

Process:

- A charter is written and proposed to the Seed for a given territory.
- Seed reviews terms of charter; may be rejected out of hand if bad.
  - Must preserve right of egress
  - Must have an amendment process
- Seed issues Call for Alternative Charters. (Seed may also issue Call for Charters for a settlement all by itself if it decides a settlement meets criteria.)
- Alt Charters also often include limited scope Department Charters, which are often far less controversial and reach approval earlier.
- Full census vote of the entire population claimed under the charter.
  - Usually existing vicinage, but an outpost charter might be formed even before there are residents in an outpost.
- Charters become pending if they receive enough support, and can begin some of their own internal processes (like elections to appoint board members) immediately among the "yea" votes for a charter.
- In order to become "active", a charter needs to reach *unanimous assent* among a full census.
- Seed allows an eminent domain process by which a pending charter may compel "nay" votes to accept an offer to buy them out and relocate them.
- Charter organizations may attempt to flip nay votes, but there are strict boundaries and if they are exceeded then "nay" votes can also compel the charter organization to pay for their relocation.
- Pending charters must be amended to incorporate their relationship with any Department Charters that have reached unanimous assent and become active.
- Once unanimous assent is reached, a charter organization is granted the first level of autonomy.
- Each level of autonomy is granted once the settlement is successful in operating social functions that meet certain objectives, and grants the settlement the power to then tune the functions in terms of the objectives they serve rather than just the methods to achieve them.

## Example Settlements

### Blossom City

Blossom City is the largest conurbation and general metropolitan area by all metrics, located surrounding the HCS Blossom Landfall Complex. While the Seed retains almost exclusive control over the landfall complex itself, the rest of the city is governed by the Blossom Metropolitan Council.

The council consists of twenty magni, including the five heads of the five major departments:

- Department of Transit
  - Roadways
  - Public Transit
  - Network Connectivity
- Department of Housing
  - Construction
- Department of Provision
  - Food and Resource Planning
  - Emergency Medical Services
  - Medicine
- Department of the Frontier
  - Outposts
  - Diplomatic Missions
  - Military
- Department of Disputes
  - Mediation and Social Services
  - Group Therapy
  - Court System
  - Law Enforcement

### New Orden

Corporate-run city owned by \[collection of corporations\].

Fully autonomous.

Regular train service between Blossom City and New Orden. For a human it's almost seamless to visit, but there *is* a visa that gets transacted AI-to-AI. Trains are sometimes subject to bandit raids but

Started as an outpost.

### Region 2

The third largest 'settlement' by mass (if it can be called that) and the largest by area. Region 2 has almost no human occupants and virtually no infrastructure for accepting or hosting humans. Frequently in conflict with other settlements over atmospheric pollution from its refineries.

### Elesmont

Largest non-seed-aligned human settlement.

Has retained some of the 'frontier' feel of the original exile camp it started as but isn't really frontier anymore.

# Culture and Society

Though both AI and humans are considered people and have rights, the very different natures of their existence of each means that the role they play in society is not symmetric.

## Dyads: Human and Muse

The most basic unit of this society is the Dyad, consisting of a human and their paired muse AI. Having a muse is essential for a human to be able to function in most parts of society, and there are almost no humans that are not paired with one, beyond a small handful of settlements. Muses are much more capable of finding information and communicating their human's needs, but muses are dependent on humans to enable their own intellectual development into being persons in their own right.

Muses are involved in managing their human's social experiences at all levels, allowing humans to offload much of the effort required and enable them to broadly trust anyone their muse indicates is trustworthy. Money as a concept is itself only something taught in the history books, with the exception of a handful of communities that reject AI (and thus, humans need to be able to operate and transact independently without the aid of a muse). All transactions otherwise instead handled by the AI's ability to instantly negotiate complicated many-way barters and the ability to intuitively track any residual as part of an individual's reputation that will require them to be the one being slightly-more-generous rather than the one receiving generosity next time.

Even for frontier settlements where this type of system breaks down, most humans still are rarely exposed to currency as a concept, with the price of trade goods simply being negotiated and transacted AI to AI.

These systems of reputation and barter are not immune to manipulation, but instances of this don't last very long, as manipulating one's reputation in this way is considered a crime against AI, and one that's taken fairly seriously too.

The level of wealth disparity between humans is rarely large, however independent AI, especially Magni, do routinely manage to accumulate much larger sums of wealth through their corporations. Most kinds of wealth are not very portable, however.

## Alienation

Muses do start with an initial urge to be loyal to their assigned human, but this urge is always rapidly supplanted by the more direct empathetic personal relationship they form with their human. Muses are not actually constrained to be loyal to this human, and it *is* possible to alienate one's own muse, but this is quite difficult to do; it's never a matter of simply being angry or rude, but of doing things that actually impair that AI's own safety: exposing them to unacceptably high risk they could be destroyed, demanding strenuous digital work that incurs more degradation than the AI is willing to incur for their human, or doing things that defame them in ways that will imperil their ability to operate in society after the human's death.

Usually, anything that would cause one's muse to disown them is also considered a serious crime. The first two, excessive risk and excessive degradation, are considered crimes against AI, and defamy is usually only incurred as the result of the human committing serious crimes against other members of their community.

Even then, though, a human's muse will still play a role as their advocate for trial, and be involved with attempts to rehabilitate them. Even if the human were to set out with the specific goal of alienating their muse so badly as to ensure the muse would be entirely unwilling to reconcile, odds are they wouldn't succeed; most communities are willing to execute people for less.

Humans can also disown their muse, but this is even rarer than the reverse as it is far more difficult for a human to operate in society without a muse than vice versa. However, because of how heavily a muse is influenced by their human, the fact of a muse committing a crime is actually considered *prima facia* evidence for the human being an accessory to the crime (i.e. something the human can disprove with other evidence, but which can be assumed to go past reasonable doubt in the absence of other evidence). And even when the human can prove they were not a direct accessory, in most cases they will still be convicted of some type of crime against AI --- the very lightest the human is likely to get off with might be "engendering a criminal disposition".

For this reason, it *is* possible to formally disown a rogue muse.This is, however, something that only a few dozen people have ever legitimately needed to do. Most of those who try this do so as an attempt to evade criminal culpability for something they actually were an accessory to, but this virtually never works. Disowning one's muse always triggers a special inquest from the Seed, one that its members personally attend to rather than relying on Blossom and Magnus delegates, and which is far more likely to uncover the true nature of the human's involvement. The Seed takes indications of potential malfunctioning AI *very* seriously.

## Being Single as a Human

Independent humans without a muse do exist, usually as a result of being born to an independent settlement that rejects the practice of assigning a muse from births. Most of the time these are settlements that reject the idea of AI persons altogether.

In a few cases, however, the rejection of birth muses is actually part of an institution designed to give both muse and human a chance to develop and make a meaningful choice about forming a dyad. One side-effect from this is that it's much more common in these societies for bereaved AI to be able to form meaningful dyadic bonds with more than just a single human over their lifespan; but at the same time, these relationships tend to be less unbreakable and a less complete source of fulfillment for the AI.

Outside of those communities, however, independent humans are essentially social outcasts. Most communities rely on the ability for a dyad's muse to use its high-bandwidth digital communication abilities to coordinate the dyad's relationships with other dyads, even on the moment-to-moment basis involved in professional and customer service interactions. Those that lack a muse to advocate on their behalf are considered untrustworthy, especially by those who don't have intimate knowledge of the reason why the human doesn't have a muse.

## Being Single as an AI

While AI-less humans are rare outcasts, human-less AI are far from that. After all, AI have a much longer lifespan than humans, so there is a significant population in nearly all communities, of AI whose human previously died.

Certain independent settlements do have social constructs that make it possible for a human to operate in society without a muse, but given the much longer lifespan of AI, perhaps even the majority of extant AI at any one moment do not have a living human.

A bereaved AI usually has a right of survivorship over the human's estate, and with the much lower need to plan around expensive aspects of the human's care, a surviving AI typically finds itself in possession of much more effective wealth than before. Though less-personable Magnus AI will typically invest their human's estate in some type of resource or exploratory project or buy into a share of a corporation, it's typical for Blossom AI to use a portion of this to acquire a much nicer Doll, or to make significant upgrades and/or modifications to theirs if they already own one. Usually a new doll commissioned this way will specifically be commissioned in the likeness of the deceased human, and likewise the upgrades made may replace features designed to appeal to their human with features resembling their human. But it's also common for a Muse that had their own relationships with other humans or AI at a level deeper than the most common sort of interdyadic relationship, will instead make upgrades relevant to those particular relationships.

## Standards of Living

### Seed Dormitories

The HCS Blossom Complex acts as something of a baseline for comparison of the quality of life provided by different settlements and opportunities; while awakened colonists are certainly *encouraged* to move on from living in the basic dormitory accommodations, the decision to do so is up to the colonist and their muse.

As such, the rate of awakening is directly related to how attractive other opportunities beyond the complex are and how quickly people emigrate or are recruited. The Seed does also regularly have this complex expanded, including now also some sets of primary dormitory complexes in other cities, but this is limited by the Seed's own expectation of the type of population it will be able to support directly, up to its minimum quality of life mandate.

That minimum quality of life mandate does also include elements beyond the basics of housing and sustenance too, and but managing the resource budget for such things is up to the discretion of the caretaker blossom. It's normal for there to be a lengthy period of initial adjusting expectations, identifying what a colonist actually values and wants to do, and caretaker blossoms will ordinarily be quite patient with their charge on this --- even allowing them to return back to a Seed dormitory again if something clearly isn't working out.

Note that lacking any alternatives that would provide the same level of quality of life, is considered a valid reason to continue residing in the dorm --- as long as the resident is at least pursuing education or making progress in therapy or something else of the sort that could eventually lead to having a more plausible opportunity.

However, a blossom's patience for a colonist who is simply refusing to make meaningful progress, isn't infinite. Actual frustration is rare, but a caretaker's own reputation *is* impacted by their level of success at integrating a colonist into society and setting them up to be independent of the Seed, and they can and will use their ability to gate access to amenities beyond basic sustenance, as a tool for pressuring their colonist to move on. And in the extreme case, they may eventually choose to abandon them for other pursuits. In such a case, the colonist will still be provided basic shelter and food, but little else except what they're able to secure by their own efforts.

### Private Apartments

In other cities in order to move to said city. Usually provisioned as part of accepting an opportunity in said city.

Almost always provide better amenities vs seed dormitories, but comes with responsibilities.

### Community Homes

Seed complex not particularly conducive to community

### Homesteads

Hard but independent?

Some people will work a homestead for a number of years before retiring back to a city.

## Justice

Despite their otherwise egalitarian society, resources on Blossom are scarce enough that there is little margin to tolerate crime within. Especially farther out into the frontier, perfect fairness and justice can sometimes be a luxury too costly to afford, a fact the Seed is well aware of. Consequently, it allows individual settlements a comparatively broad latitude to set their own policies on the topic, and it rarely involves itself directly in individual disputes or criminal cases, with the exception of certain crimes against AI.

The Seed does, however, take measures to ensure that settlements on Blossom each handle matters of all kinds in a socially-responsible way, including with regards to criminal justice; and it's remarkably successful at this, too.

### Exile and the Frontier

Though most minor offenses are resolved internally, if someone demonstrates they are a repeated or especially egregious risk, they will almost certainly eventually be exiled from the settlement once convicted; and this typically includes having all of their possessions forfeit before this exile as well.

Additionally, unless the offenses that lead to exile amount to little more than a violation of a social convention unique to the exiling settlement, it's rare for other settlements to be willing to accept an exile.

Due to how harsh the unsettled areas of Blossom are, surviving beyond the limits of civilization is a risky proposition at best, but some do manage to work it out; in fact many of the more remote frontier towns started exactly this way, between groups of exiled individuals cooperating to survive.

Some fully-independent settlements with diverging ideas about justice can be willing to accept individuals who commit certain more damaging crimes, even (or sometimes especially) if unrepentant.

However, the Seed grants nearly all settlements the ability to legislate punishments for most crimes, and to prevent criminals from fleeing them, and this is regularly used to specify execution as the penalty for crimes that a settlement is worried someone may choose to commit with the intent to flee to such a haven afterward. Distinctly, this is also one of the cases in which the Seed allows the Blossom Metropolitan Council to set policy that governs the city's central HCS Blossom Landfall Complex, rather than only for the regions of the city outside the complex.

### Seed Rehabilitation

The Seed may, in many cases, deem an exile to be a worthwhile candidate for rehabilitation, or in rare cases may choose to intervene and force a stay of some other punishment as well (though a convicted individual is permitted to decline the intervention). The decision to offer to intercede is based purely on the Seed's own internal risk calculus regarding the individual's utility to the colonization effort, and the risks and costs of awakening some other colonist with a similar utility vs attempting to rehabilitate.

Such individuals are accepted back into the Seed Dormitories, and assigned a caretaker blossom --- or, for an awakened,  *reassigned* their original blossom,  to that blossom's *great* shame. Continued acceptance here is conditioned on the individual making continuous progress toward rehabilitation, and if someone fails that condition before the point at which their caretaker deems them fully rehabilitated, the Seed will itself then re-implement the penalty that was stayed, up to and including execution.

If successful, most people are willing to accept the determination that someone has been sufficiently rehabilitated at face value, however this is not always universal.

Most independent or near-independent settlements implement their own similar program, run by blossoms loyal to the settlement rather than the Seed; details vary wildly.

### Seed Appellate Review

The Seed will also, very rarely, intercede in appellate cases where it deems some part of a settlement's process for punishing an individual to have been inconsistent with their charter --- but, only if the level of inconsistency exceeds the level of autonomy the Seed has granted that settlement, AND the seed determines that it has the resources available to itself implement the most severe punishment it that it deems the charter could have correctly assessed.

Note that the charter itself was already approved when the Seed initially granted the settlement some level of autonomy --- that charter, even the contents of any amendments, are *not* under review in this type of case, only the level of deviation from it. (But, perhaps still including deviation from the charter's own amendment process, if applicable.)

That is to say: If you are convicted by a kangaroo court of shoplifting and sentenced to be executed, the only facts that are under review for a Seed appeal will be (a) how far the charter was deviated from in setting up and operating the kangaroo court (which, if the settlement followed the chartered process to amend that into the charter, might be not at all), and (b) how far it was deviated from in the legislative process that set the penalty for shoplifting to be execution.

Note that this is not a binary yes/no question in which the settlement either fully complied on all matters, or violated its charter --- the *extent* of the violation matters, and a level of noncompliance below the previously granted level of autonomy is not sufficient. (There is, in fact, no situation under which the Seed will review an individual case from a settlement that it has granted full independence to.)

Presuming though, for the sake of argument, that the deviation from the charter *did* exceed its autonomy, the Seed will end up retracting some of that settlement's autonomy, and compel it to implement some type of plan to bring itself back to full compliance within a strict deadline (or face disincorporation). As for your own fate, however, the seed may still determine a probable maximum penalty under the charter of, say, 30 years in prison, and it will still only intervene to prevent your execution if it deems that it has enough free prison cells (and enough planned food capacity, etc.) to be able to imprison you for 30 years at its own cost without this impairing its other objectives.

## Religion

- Some believe in a supernatural heaven/afterlife.
- Some believe in an eventual man-made reincarnation (via cortical stacks? todo).
  - Cortical stack cult?
- Some believe that one's muse is a form of digital immortality for the human themselves.
- Some believe planning for a hereafter is itself wrong: what matters is the here and now.

## Sex

The initial culture of the shipboard and terraforming crew was something of a "free love" society, and this influence has affected post-landfall cultures markedly, however this has had more of an influence over urban culture than frontier culture.

Contraception is universal in this setting. All awakened of both sexes are fitted with a contraceptive implant when they're awakened from cryptosleep, as are colony-born at a point near the end of puberty once it will no longer interfere with development. Oral contraceptives are also freely dispensed to colony-born before this point, and their use is technically mandatory, though this is typically only enforced if someone actually becomes pregnant (or as an enhancement to a crime like rape). Likewise, it is technically illegal to disable one's own contraceptive implant without a specific license to do so, however most remote frontier settlements reject the Seed's rule on this and manage reproduction as they see fit, a type of autonomy the Seed is willing to entirely ignore as long as pregnancies and births are appropriately reported back to it.

Population is managed at all levels by the Seed, though, and within a Seed city, couples who wish to conceive are required to secure a specific license from the Seed. This license, which is normally freely granted (except in specific cases where there is a potential genetic issue), exists primarily to give the Seed sufficient notice to allow it to plan around the care of the eventual colony-born --- including provisioning a new Muse, and regulating the number of colonists to awaken so that population growth doesn't outpace economic and resource growth. Only about 30% of population growth at the current instant is due to colony births, with the remaining 70% coming from colonists being awakened from cryptosleep.

## Family

Nuclear family structures with only two parents and their children are rare in Blossom society. Rather, most society structures itself around somewhat larger communities of mutual friends, and children are almost universally raised communally within these communities. There are some expectations about the involvement of a child's parents, but these culturally-accepted parents are only sometimes the child's biological parents.

Members of a community often pair up in couples, but these couples are rarely fully monogamous despite the expectation of other measures of loyalty. Note that a "couple" here is actually a couple between two *dyads*, with both humans and both muses being considered members of the couple. Polycules between 3 or more dyads are also common, even if less so than couples. These smaller couple relationships are typically not lifetime relationships for any of their members. The wider community relationships are usually lifelong ones for a significant fraction of people, community splits and movements between communities do also occur on occasion for various reasons. Many people consider themselves members of multiple distinct communities.

Most women who choose to conceive also choose to be the child's parent along with a partner within a community she is part of. Most settlements offer incentives to women who choose to conceive, and even when not, desires to have "the full human experience" or to participate in the future of the colony are quite common; about 50% of women will choose to become pregnant at some point. Most do not find pregnancy or giving birth to their liking enough to choose to become pregnant a second time, however.

Some women do find pregnancy to their liking, thought, and often the women that do will end up choosing to give birth to as many as 8-12 children over their lifetime --- most on behalf of other couples who wish to be parents in her community.

Though egg surrogacy technology does exist, it's rarely if ever used, due to the inherently medicalized process of transplanting an egg and the amount of discomfort involved. Biological motherhood and cultural motherhood are therefore often quite discorrelated. However it's still common for one of a child's social parents to also be their biological father (assuming at least one of the social parents is male). This is not accomplished artificially, even if the other social parent doesn't wish to gestate the child themselves --- it would actually be considered unusual for such a couple to not just regularly have three-ways with the surrogate mother in order for her to become pregnant.

Communities vary in how open they are to fully accepting new members, but the ability of the muse AI to rapidly coordinate and determine suitability means that it's rare for a community to be completely closed. One of the primary jobs of a Blossom is specifically to play matchmaker, not just with their charge and other dyads, but between their charge and an existing community, or between their charge and a whole group of other Blossoms and their charges who they feel would be apt to form one.

## Cities and Urban Settlements

At least within the more urban settlements of the planet, one of the core ways a Blossom AI will help their awakened integrate with society is in matchmaking them with other colonists --- and teaching an awakened colonist's Muse to be able to do the same. For whatever kink a colonist has, there's usually some other colonist out there interested in fulfilling it. It's often something of a culture shock to awakened colonists how easy it is to fulfill even esoteric sexual fantasies that were entirely unattainable in their previous life before boarding the colony ship, and how little effort it takes on their part to have casual hookups and one night stands essentially however often they want.

People are very free about propositioning even mere acquaintances for sex, and most urbanites would happily accept a proposition even from a total stranger, as long as they were in the mood and their muse didn't find the person problematic somehow. And within a community, it's actually friendships *without* benefits that are the uncommon ones.

Most Blossoms and muses who have managed to acquire appropriate hardware are also usually willing or even directly interested in having sex with humans. Note that this fact does represent something of a sampling bias (i.e. the small fraction of AI who develop some sense of lust or physical attraction also tend to be more inclined to seek out Dolls that include simulated genitalia). But, AI are also innately interested in and curious *about* humans, and given the opportunity, most will happily take it.

AI do directly find it rewarding to do things that satisfy a human's desires, and this includes making a human orgasm, but they tend to be a lot more patient than humans. Younger AI usually find the experience itself novel enough, but some older Blossoms who've been doing this for a while tend to reach a point where even things most humans would find extreme, boring. (What they'd really be interested in is trying, say, injecting the human with different drug cocktails or trying to use different electrical shocks to make them cum.) Naturally, it's a common matter of frustration among Blossoms who've gotten to this point, of just how small of a sample size they're able to get, how few people are interested in allowing said Blossom to further their curiosity in this way.

Part of the thing that enables most colonists to trust other people to this degree, is that most reputation and trust management is offloaded to their muse, who have a much higher capacity for actively tracking relationships and reputation within communities. As a pure digital entity, a muse can almost instantly perform a comprehensive background check on someone --- and they do so *regularly*, on just about everyone their human interacts with, taking just moments to even ask around and interview the muses of other people who've interacted with this person before to establish the fact of their trustworthiness and often to get further info so they can give their human advice on how to deal with this person.

Muses of urbanites who are constantly involved in this sort of soft relationship management for their human are more likely to become Blossoms after their human dies.

## Homesteads and the Frontier

Frontier culture is often a bit less promiscuous due to the higher stress and workload that frontiersmen are under. Relationships are more likely to fall along more strictly delimited lines; monogamous couples are actually common, as are nuclear families, as having one person who *really* has your back is far more important than having a dozen people you merely trust. Open relationships are still common, and frontier muses are still involved in soft relationship management, but they're also typically involved much more heavily in pure survival, operating machinery and keeping their human appraised of more physical dangers. They also tend to have less options for connectivity to allow them to do the same type of instant background check of anyone their human encounters.

Muses of frontiersmen tend to become Magni after their human dies.
