# Mission Statement
The Grand Empty is a discord server community for writers who wish to hone their craft and participate in a sci-fi horror advanced-literate role playing game.

# Objectives
The Grand Empty is governed under the following objectives:

1. Members can expect the community's leaders to act with discretion and exercise the technical powers they are afforded solely for the benefit of the community.
2. Members can expect all but designated areas of the community to be broadly "safe for work", and to have sensitive topics properly marked and handled with maturity and grace.
3. Members can expect their time and energy to be respected and for their contributions not to be disrupted by irrelevant or inappropriate material.
4. Members can expect to interact with peers invested in the norms, style, and future of the community, and to engage with active, thoughtful criticism.
5. Members can expect all parts of the community to be fully accessible, and to have their needs respected and accomidated within the bounds of technical feasibility.

# Guidelines
1. **Help writers succeed, not characters.** Your characters should be ambitious, feel pain, and hold grudges. To write these things well requires empathy, but don't let your empathy for your characters interfere with your empathy for the real people you write with. Celebrate other's well-written triumphs, and engineer comebacks from failure, *especially* for your characters' enemies.
  1. **Be agreeable, especially when you disagree.** Active, thoughtful criticism is a core part of this community, but remember to criticize _ideas, not people_. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, knee-jerk contradictions, or responses to a post's tone rather than its content.
  2. **Make your writing accessible.** We recommend [rentry.co](https://rentry.co/) for character sheets and worldbuilding documents, but other solutions exist. Users are welcome to use more expressive formatting for artistic reasons, as long as they also maintain an accessible version and provide links to both.
2. **Post your own writing.** When a user disengages from the creative process by plagiarizing writing from elsewhere, writing quality suffers and its users become less able to usefully discuss it and collaborate with other users. 
  1. **Do not use AI.** Anyone who wanted to write with an AI chatbot could do that on their own; we come here to write with real people. Using AI violates other user's privacy when you share their writing with a third party, even an LLM.
  2. **Images are not the focus.** This is a community for writing, so our rules for non-writing content are more relaxed. Drawing or commissioning your own artwork is admirable and encouraged, but not required. Citing images or linking them directly from their source is preferred. AI-generated artwork may not be used for any purpose. Users are presumed to have obtained appropriate usage rights for anything they share.
3. **Be patient.** Allow other writers room to respond to your posts in their own time. We all have lives outside this community and have to prioritize other things over just writing.
  1. **Don't ping excessively.** A second reminder ping sooner than 2 days after the first is usually excessive.
  2. **Respect your commitments.** Don't keep other users waiting. If you expect to take longer than usual to respond, communicate and find solutions instead of ghosting.
4. **Handle mature themes maturely.** Depravity should be acknowledged and understood, but leave reveling in it to the characters. Violent, sexual, and disturbing themes and topics are allowed, but writers are expected to treat them with the gravity and respect they deserve.
  1. **Provide content warnings.** When applicable, provide a content warning in the head-post of each thread, and keep the warning up-to-date as the thread progresses. Limit especially sexual or violent material to designated NSFW channels.
  2. **Apply elevated scrutiny to underage characters.** The world of The Grand Empty is not a world devoid of children, but they are not the focus of our story. Writing may include sexual content, or it may include underage characters, but writing that includes both at once is not welcome here.
5. **Respect character autonomy.** Other members invest time and emotional energy in engaging with their characters. Don't rob other writers their opportunity to engage and have fun writing by writing their character's actions or dialogue for them.
  1. **Respect plot-scale autonomy.** Discuss and collaborate to determine any wounds, injuries, punishments, relationships, accusations, or other details that could have a long-term impact on a character.
  2. **Violate only character boundaries.** Discuss and obtain consent from a character's writer before initiating sex with their character, assaulting them, or doing anything else that could require a content warning.
  3. **Use victim-leading.** Even when a character's agency is compromised by mind-control or intoxication, _their_ writer, not the mind-controller's, still has final say on what they are mind-controlled to do.
  4. **When in doubt, communicate.** Active discussion and criticism are core to this community. It's never wrong to give other users a heads-up of what you're planning or ask for their insight or permission.

# Moderation
The Grand Empty staff apply the following guidelines when moderating the community and responding to incidents. While these guidelines help us to enforce the rules more effectively, all moderation decisions are ultimately judgment calls. We may depart from these guidelines if we feel that the community's interests are better served by an alternative approach. We recognize four broad categories of incident:

* When members don't understand the community, they may have **etiquette problems**. We aim to educate these members so that they can be properly integrated into our culture. If this approach fails after multiple attempts, the matter may be handled as a Hostility issue on the grounds that the whole community is being disrespected. Examples of etiquette issues include posting in the wrong forum thread, low-quality writing, or misusing technical features of the platform.
* Members have **hostility problems** when they disrespect other members or the community at large. Examples of hostility issues include insults, personal attacks, or inappropriate advertising. In these situations, our response will focus on protecting the community's norms and shutting down inappropriate behavior. Minor hostility problems may be handled informally, but expect repeated incidents to lead to a formal warning. Once a formal warning is issued, any further rule violations will lead to a ban.
* **Malice problems** happen when a member demonstrates that they are fundamentally incompatible with our community's values. Examples of malice problems include true threats, sexual harassment, hate speech, or spam. All malice issues will lead to an immediate ban without warning, regardless of a member's prior history.  
* Finally, we recognize **life problems**, such as inappropriate venting or support-seeking, as a distinct category. The Grand Empty is meant to support writer's interests in self-improvement, but we cannot provide counseling, medical advice, or excessive life help. Accordingly, we will dissuade or prevent members from seeking inappropriate support within The Grand Empty. The moderation team values compassion and sensitivity and will tailor its approach to a member's circumstances.

We use timeouts, formal warnings, and bans as part of our enforcement processes. Please note the following:

* Timeouts are never a "step" in the disciplinary process.  
* However, moderators may issue timeouts if they feel they would improve a situation or prevent it from worsening.  
* When formal warnings are issued, they will always be clearly marked as "formal".  
* A formal warning may be withdrawn, at moderator discretion, if a member shows significant and sustained improvement.  
* A member who continues to cause problems after being formally warned will be banned.  
* Bans never expire unless lifted by the Curator. The Curator will only lift a ban if they are convinced that doing so is in the community's interest, and may refuse to hear an appeal for any reason.  
* The Grand Empty will not accept appeals on behalf of third parties. Appeal requests should be emailed to [`thegrandempty@gmail.com`](mailto:thegrandempty@gmail.com)
