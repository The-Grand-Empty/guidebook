# Mission Statement
The Grand Empty Community is a discord server for writers who wish to hone their craft and participate in a sci-fi horror advanced-literate role playing game.

# Objectives
The Grand Empty Community is governed under the following objectives:

1. Members can expect the community's leaders to act transparently and openly, for the benefit of the community.
2. Members can expect all but designated areas of the community to be broadly "safe for work", and to have sensitive topics properly marked and handled with maturity and grace.
3. Members can expect their time and energy to be respected and for their contributions not to be disrupted by irrelevant or inappropriate material.
4. Members can expect to interact with peers invested in the norms, style, and future of the community, and to engage with active, thoughtful criticism.
5. Members can expect all parts of the community to be fully accessible, and to have their needs respected and accomidated within the bounds of technical feasibility.

# Member Guidelines
1. **Help writers succeed, not characters.** Your characters should be ambitious, feel pain, and hold grudges. To write these things well requires empathy, but don't let your empathy for your characters interfere with your empathy for the real people you write with. Celebrate other's well-written triumphs, and engineer comebacks from failure, *especially* for your characters' enemies.
   1. **Be agreeable, especially when you disagree.** Active, thoughtful criticism is a core part of this community, but remember to criticize _ideas, not people_. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, knee-jerk contradictions. Respond to posts' content, not their tone.
   2. **Make your writing accessible.** We recommend [rentry.co](https://rentry.co/) for writing samples, character sheets, and worldbuilding documents, but other solutions exist (Google Docs is _not_ one we allow). Members are welcome to use more expressive formatting for artistic reasons, as long as they also maintain an accessible version and provide links to both.
2. **Post your own writing.** When a user disengages from the creative process by plagiarizing writing from elsewhere, writing quality suffers and members become less able to usefully discuss it and collaborate with other members.
   1. **Images are not the focus.** Drawing or commissioning your own artwork is admirable and encouraged, but not required. Art must be cited or linked directly to its original source. AI-generated artwork may not be used for any purpose. Members are presumed to have obtained appropriate usage rights for anything they share.
   2. **Do not use AI.** Anyone who wanted to write with an AI chatbot could do that on their own; we come here to write with real people. Using AI violates other members' privacy when you share their writing with a third party, even an LLM.
3. **Be patient.** Allow other writers room to respond to your posts in their own time. We all have lives outside this community and have to prioritize other things over just writing.
   1. **Don't ping excessively.** A second reminder ping sooner than 2 days after the first is usually excessive.
   2. **Respect your commitments.** Don't keep other members waiting. If you expect to take longer than usual to respond, communicate and find solutions instead of ghosting.
4. **Handle mature themes maturely.** Violent, sexual, and disturbing themes and topics are allowed, but writers are expected to treat them with the gravity and respect they deserve.
   1. **Provide content warnings.** When applicable, provide a content warning in the head-post of each thread, and keep the warning up-to-date as the thread progresses. Limit especially sexual or violent material to designated NSFW channels.
   2. **Apply elevated scrutiny to underage characters.** The world of The Grand Empty is not a world devoid of children, but they are not the focus of our story. Writing may include sexual content, or it may include underage characters, but writing that includes both at once is not welcome here.
5. **Respect character autonomy.** Other members invest time and emotional energy in engaging with their characters. Don't rob other writers their opportunity to engage and have fun writing by writing their character's actions or dialogue for them.
   1. **Respect plot-scale autonomy.** Discuss and collaborate to determine any wounds, injuries, punishments, relationships, accusations, or other details that could have a long-term impact on a character.
   2. **Violate only character boundaries.** Discuss and obtain consent from a character's writer before initiating sex with their character, assaulting them, or doing anything else that could require a content warning.
   3. **Use victim-leading.** Even when a character's agency is compromised by mind-control or intoxication, _their_ writer, not the mind-controller's, still has final say on what they are mind-controlled to do.
   4. **When in doubt, communicate.** Active discussion and criticism are core to this community. It's never wrong to give other members a heads-up of what you're planning or ask for their insight or permission.

# Applications
Users must apply and be approved by the community in order to become a member and gain access to its writing and meta spaces. To apply, fill out the following template and post it in {% include discord/channel.html name="apply" id="1367936324031615106" %}:

```md
**Name:** _Discord username, and other nicknames._
**Age:** _Numeric age._
**Experience:** _1-2 sentences, summary of past writing/rp experience._
**Goals:** _1-2 sentences, what you hope to get out of The Grand Empty._
**Writing Samples:** _link(s)_
```

Once you submit this, create a thread attached to your application post to  review your application and discuss your writing sample. If there are specific goals, themes, literary techniques, worldbuilding, or anything else you think would be especially interesting to discuss, you are welcome to steer that conversation any way you like; but either way, we are looking for members interested in active discussion and who can turn a critical eye to their own writing.

Concurrently with this, a moderator with the {% include discord/role.html name="verifier" id="1367980120874287197" %} role will ping you in your application thread and request you to DM them your proof-of-age. In most cases, this means a photograph containing a hand-written note with your discord username and the current date and your government ID with all fields except your date of birth redacted.

Once the the verifier has accepted your age proof, they will review the discussion, and assuming a favorable consensus they will grant you the {% include discord/role.html name="writer" id="1367941938908627187" %} role.

# Moderation
The Grand Empty moderation team applies the following guidelines when moderating the community.

## Incidents
We recognize four broad categories of incident:

### Etiquette Problems
When members don't understand the community, they may have etiquette problems. We aim to educate these members so that they can be properly integrated into our culture. If this approach fails after multiple attempts, the matter may be handled as a Hostility issue on the grounds that the whole community is being disrespected. Examples of etiquette issues include posting in the wrong channel, low-quality writing, or misusing technical features of the platform.

### Hostility Problems
Members have hostility problems when they disrespect other members or the community at large. Examples of hostility issues include insults, personal attacks, passive-aggressive behavior, or inappropriate advertising. In these situations, our response will focus on protecting the community's norms and shutting down inappropriate behavior. Minor hostility problems may be handled informally, but expect repeated incidents to lead to a formal warning. Once a formal warning is issued, any further rule violations will lead to a ban.

### Malice Problems
Malice problems happen when a member demonstrates that they are fundamentally incompatible with our community's values. Examples of malice problems include true threats, sexual harassment, hate speech, or spam. All malice issues will lead to an immediate ban without warning, regardless of a member's prior history.

### Life Problems
Finally, we recognize **life problems**, such as inappropriate venting or support-seeking, as a distinct category. The Grand Empty is meant to support writer's interests in self-improvement, but we cannot provide counseling, medical advice, or excessive life help. Accordingly, we will dissuade or prevent members from seeking inappropriate support within The Grand Empty. The moderation team values compassion and sensitivity and will tailor its approach to a member's circumstances.

## Timeouts, Warnings, and Bans

We use timeouts, formal warnings, and bans as part of our enforcement processes. Please note the following:

* Timeouts are never a "step" in the disciplinary process.  
* However, moderators may issue timeouts if they feel they would improve a situation or prevent it from worsening.  
* When formal warnings are issued, they will always be clearly marked as "formal".  
* A formal warning may be withdrawn, at moderator discretion, if a member shows significant and sustained improvement.  
* A member who continues to cause problems after being formally warned will be banned.  
* Bans never expire unless lifted by the BDFL. The BDFL will only lift a ban if they are convinced that doing so is in the community's interest, and may refuse to hear an appeal for any reason.  
* The Grand Empty will not accept appeals on behalf of third parties. Appeal requests should be emailed to [`thegrandempty@gmail.com`](mailto:thegrandempty@gmail.com)

## Transparency and Accountability
These guidelines help us to maintain our community's norms and defend its members' time and investment effectively, but all moderation decisions are ultimately judgment calls, and our judgements are not above criticism.

With certain exceptions for matters with unique privacy concerns (such as harassment cases or our age verification process), discussions about the community or its members may occur only through community-auditable channels. When privileged actions are taken (e.g. approving or banning a user, issuing or retracting a formal warning), the moderator performing that action must make it clear that they are taking responsibility for its correctness and appropriateness, often by posting in {% include discord/channel.html name="audit" id="1367900617422409819" %}.

Nobody is above criticism; any member is welcome to raise concerns or objection in {% include discord/channel.html name="meta" id="1367900579753361408" %}, at any time, for any reason. Active hostility and rudeness is still not tolerated, but moderators are expected to recuse themselves when their own actions or writing are implicated, and must not take privileged actions on their own behalf.

This community is currently run by a [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life), and the moderators they appoint at their discretion. We are committed to stepping down as and when requested by community consensus, and can only hope that once this community reaches a size suitable for community elections you'll finally let us rest instead of continuing to elect us.

Banned or otherwise aggrieved members of our community are, as anyone else, welcome to take advantage of our world's open-source licensing to continue to participate with The Grand Empty in whatever successor communities they build.
