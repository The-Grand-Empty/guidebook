# Mission Statement
The Grand Empty Community is a discord server for writers who wish to hone their craft and participate in a sci-fi horror advanced-literate role playing game.

# Objectives
The Grand Empty Community is governed under the following objectives:

1. Members can expect the community's leaders to act transparently and openly, for the benefit of the community.
2. Members can expect all but designated areas of the community to be broadly "safe for work", and to have sensitive topics properly marked and handled with maturity and grace.
3. Members can expect their time and energy to be respected and for their contributions not to be disrupted by irrelevant or inappropriate material.
4. Members can expect to interact with peers invested in the norms, style, and future of the community, and to engage with active, thoughtful criticism.
5. Members can expect all parts of the community to be fully accessible, and to have their needs respected and accomidated within the bounds of technical feasibility.

# Member Guidelines
1. **Help writers succeed, not characters.** Your characters should be ambitious, feel pain, and hold grudges. To write these things well requires empathy, but don't let your empathy for your characters interfere with your empathy for the real people you write with. Celebrate other's well-written triumphs, and engineer comebacks from failure, *especially* for your characters' enemies.
   1. **Be agreeable, especially when you disagree.** Active, thoughtful criticism is a core part of this community, but remember to criticize _ideas, not people_. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, knee-jerk contradictions. Respond to posts' content, not their tone.
   2. **Make your writing accessible.** We recommend [rentry.co](https://rentry.co/) for writing samples, character sheets, and worldbuilding documents, but other solutions exist (Google Docs is _not_ one we allow). Members are welcome to use more expressive formatting for artistic reasons, as long as they also maintain an accessible version and provide links to both.
2. **Post your own writing.** When a user disengages from the creative process by plagiarizing writing from elsewhere, writing quality suffers and members become less able to usefully discuss it and collaborate with other members.
   1. **Images are not the focus.** Drawing or commissioning your own artwork is admirable and encouraged, but not required. Art must be cited or linked directly to its original source. AI-generated artwork may not be used for any purpose. Members are presumed to have obtained appropriate usage rights for anything they share.
   2. **Do not use AI.** Anyone who wanted to write with an AI chatbot could do that on their own; we come here to write with real people. Using AI violates other members' privacy when you share their writing with a third party, even an LLM.
3. **Be patient.** Allow other writers room to respond to your posts in their own time. We all have lives outside this community and have to prioritize other things over just writing.
   1. **Don't ping excessively.** A second reminder ping sooner than 2 days after the first is usually excessive.
   2. **Respect your commitments.** Don't keep other members waiting. If you expect to take longer than usual to respond, communicate and find solutions instead of ghosting.
4. **Handle mature themes maturely.** Violent, sexual, and disturbing themes and topics are allowed, but writers are expected to treat them with the gravity and respect they deserve.
   1. **Provide content warnings.** When applicable, provide a content warning in the head-post of each thread, and keep the warning up-to-date as the thread progresses. Limit especially sexual or violent material to designated NSFW channels.
   2. **Apply elevated scrutiny to underage characters.** The world of The Grand Empty is not a world devoid of children, but they are not the focus of our story. Writing may include sexual content, or it may include underage characters, but writing that includes both at once is not welcome here.
5. **Respect character autonomy.** Other members invest time and emotional energy in engaging with their characters. Don't rob other writers their opportunity to engage and have fun writing by writing their character's actions or dialogue for them.
   1. **Respect plot-scale autonomy.** Discuss and collaborate to determine any wounds, injuries, punishments, relationships, accusations, or other details that could have a long-term impact on a character.
   2. **Violate only character boundaries.** Discuss and obtain consent from a character's writer before initiating sex with their character, assaulting them, or doing anything else that could require a content warning.
   3. **Use victim-leading.** Even when a character's agency is compromised by mind-control or intoxication, _their_ writer, not the mind-controller's, still has final say on what they are mind-controlled to do.
   4. **When in doubt, communicate.** Active discussion and criticism are core to this community. It's never wrong to give other members a heads-up of what you're planning or ask for their insight or permission.

# Posting
## Applications
Users must apply and be approved by the community in order to become a member and gain access to its writing and meta spaces. To apply, fill out the following template and post it in {% include discord/channel.html name="apply" id="1367936324031615106" %}:

```md
**Name:** _Discord username, and other nicknames._
**Age:** _Numeric age._
**Experience:** _1-2 sentences, summary of past writing/rp experience._
**Goals:** _1-2 sentences, what you hope to get out of The Grand Empty._
**Writing Samples:** _https://rentry.co/ link(s)_
```

You may not have very much experience with storytelling or roleplay --- that's fine! We do require members to demonstrate at bare minimum level of literacy, but even if the last serious writing you've done was your college thesis or even a high-school essay, we're happy to accept that!

Once you submit your application, create a thread with your username as the thread title attached to that post, for moderators and other writers to use to review your application and discuss your writing with you. If there are specific goals, themes, literary techniques, worldbuilding, or anything else you think would be especially interesting to discuss, you are welcome to steer that conversation any way you like; but either way, we are looking for members interested in active discussion and who can turn a critical eye to their own writing.

Concurrently with this, a moderator with the {% include discord/role.html name="verifier" id="1367980120874287197" %} role will ping you in your application thread and request you to DM them your proof-of-age. In most cases, this means a photograph containing a hand-written note with your discord username and the current date and your government ID with all fields except your date of birth redacted.

Once the the verifier has accepted your age proof, they will review the discussion, and assuming a favorable consensus they will grant you the {% include discord/role.html name="writer" id="1367941938908627187" %} role.

## Roleplay Threads

The channels {% include discord/channel.html name="rp-general" id="1367935861026721922" %} and {% include discord/channel.html name="rp-nsfw" id="1368623729483059312" %} are designated for roleplay threads. Top-level posts in these channels should contain only a post header; the writing itself should be done in threads attached to these posts. Use the following template for header posts:

```md
**Writers:** _@Alice; @Bob; @Claire_
**Characters:** _Frank Arlich, Amias The Second; Elizabeth "Beth" Smith; Cudethar the Crusher_
**Synopsis:** _1-2 sentences, describe expected events, tone, etc_
**Content Warnings:** _arson, misgendering, assault, weapons_
**Status:** _open/active/complete_
```

In order to make sure it's easy to find past threads and other information about a thread's writers and characters, make sure to include `@username` pings for every user involved in the list of writers, and include the full name of every character spelled exactly the same as their [roster entry](#roster) if applicable. It's also encouraged (but not required) to make the character's name a link to their catalog thread, and include links to relevant past threads and catalog entries in the synopsis.

The content warnings should be a list of keyword-style tags. Prefer general but non-euphemistic terms, and name all specific categories of content that the scene's writers anticipate might be most objectionable. (This is partly an exercise to help writers stay scope-conscious, even beyond its use to others in deciding whether to engage with a thread.) Keep the content warnings up-to-date as the scene progresses; let the user who posted the heading know if there's something you think should be listed so they can edit it.

The status portion should indicate `open` while a writer is looking for more writers to join and help develop their scene's premise, `active` once a story is underway, and `complete` once no further posts are expected in the thread.

> Free-For-All / Live RP Overflow Threads
>
> At the moment, the server only includes a single channel intended for live/FFA style roleplay, {% include discord/channel.html name="rp-ffa" id="1368990702670713083" %}. We're trying to limit the number of channels in favor of a tight signal-to-noise ratio. If there's demand, we're happy to expand the number of FFA channels and designate some of them for specific locations or topics.
> If you want this, please let us know in {% include discord/channel.html name="meta" id="1367900579753361408" %} --- and let us know what specific locations or topics you'd like designated!
> In the mean time, if the general FFA channel is in use, you are welcome to create threads in {% include discord/channel.html name="rp-general" id="1367935861026721922" %} to use for FFA; mark them with the status `ffa` to indicate this.

## Catalogs
As you write, you will develop characters and worldbuild elements of The Grand Empty related to the stories you write. Catalog posts, in {% include discord/channel.html name="roster" id="1367936272571695195" %} and {% include discord/channel.html name="gazeteer" id="1369009449804497011" %}, exist as a way to allow other writers to easily find info about your characters and to make your worldbuilding accessible for others to take inspiration from and potentially reuse.

### Roster
Each {% include discord/channel.html name="roster" id="1367936272571695195" %} post should be about a single character, and include the characters full name and any nicknames or aliases they are commonly referred to by. Briefly summarize the most pertinent details about the character, and include a link to an accessible copy of any character sheet. If you wish to track a character's appearances, adventures, development, or other info, you may do so in a thread on the character's roster entry.

> Proxy Posting: Tupperbox, PluralKit, etc.
>
> We are currently considering whether or not to add a bot to enable proxy-posting, i.e. automatically replacing specially-tagged user posts with posts that show a character-specific username and profile image.
> There are several different Discord bots that implement this same essential concept in more or less usable ways, and many different conventions we could adopt for their use that trade off on artistic vs accessibility goals.
> We want to make the best possible trade-offs for all concerned --- so let us know _your_ opinions in {% include discord/channel.html name="meta" id="1367900579753361408" %}!

### Gazetteer
{% include discord/channel.html name="gazetteer" id="1369009449804497011" %} posts are similar to those in {% include discord/channel.html name="roster" id="1367936272571695195" %}, but can be more general: regarding a location, group, company, technology, artifact, species, culture, classification system, or anything else you care to worldbuild.

If something here gets widespread use, we'll be happy to grant you edit access to create a guidebook page about it, too!

# Moderation
The Grand Empty moderation team applies the following guidelines when moderating the community.

## Incidents
We recognize four broad categories of incident:

### Etiquette Problems
When members don't understand the community, they may have etiquette problems. We aim to educate these members so that they can be properly integrated into our culture. If this approach fails after multiple attempts, the matter may be handled as a Hostility issue on the grounds that the whole community is being disrespected. Examples of etiquette issues include posting in the wrong channel, low-quality writing, or misusing technical features of the platform.

### Hostility Problems
Members have hostility problems when they disrespect other members or the community at large. Examples of hostility issues include insults, personal attacks, passive-aggressive behavior, or inappropriate advertising. In these situations, our response will focus on protecting the community's norms and shutting down inappropriate behavior. Minor hostility problems may be handled informally, but expect repeated incidents to lead to a formal warning. Once a formal warning is issued, any further rule violations will lead to a ban.

### Malice Problems
Malice problems happen when a member demonstrates that they are fundamentally incompatible with our community's values. Examples of malice problems include true threats, sexual harassment, hate speech, or spam. All malice issues will lead to an immediate ban without warning, regardless of a member's prior history.

### Life Problems
Finally, we recognize **life problems**, such as inappropriate venting or support-seeking, as a distinct category. The Grand Empty is meant to support writer's interests in self-improvement, but we cannot provide counseling, medical advice, or excessive life help. Accordingly, we will dissuade or prevent members from seeking inappropriate support within The Grand Empty. The moderation team values compassion and sensitivity and will tailor its approach to a member's circumstances.

## Timeouts, Warnings, and Bans

We use timeouts, formal warnings, and bans as part of our enforcement processes. Please note the following:

* Timeouts are never a "step" in the disciplinary process.  
* However, moderators may issue timeouts if they feel they would improve a situation or prevent it from worsening.  
* When formal warnings are issued, they will always be clearly marked as "formal".  
* A formal warning may be withdrawn, at moderator discretion, if a member shows significant and sustained improvement.  
* A member who continues to cause problems after being formally warned will be banned.  
* Bans never expire unless lifted by the BDFL. The BDFL will only lift a ban if they are convinced that doing so is in the community's interest, and may refuse to hear an appeal for any reason.  
* The Grand Empty will not accept appeals on behalf of third parties. Appeal requests should be emailed to [`thegrandempty@gmail.com`](mailto:thegrandempty@gmail.com)

## Transparency and Accountability
These guidelines help us to maintain our community's norms and defend its members' time and investment effectively, but all moderation decisions are ultimately judgment calls, and our judgements are not above criticism.

With certain exceptions for matters with unique privacy concerns (such as harassment cases or our age verification process), discussions about the community or its members may occur only through community-auditable channels. When privileged actions are taken (e.g. approving or banning a user, issuing or retracting a formal warning), the moderator performing that action must make it clear that they are taking responsibility for its correctness and appropriateness, often by posting in {% include discord/channel.html name="audit" id="1367900617422409819" %}.

Nobody is above criticism; any member is welcome to raise concerns or objection in {% include discord/channel.html name="meta" id="1367900579753361408" %}, at any time, for any reason. Active hostility and rudeness is still not tolerated, but moderators are expected to recuse themselves when their own actions or writing are implicated, and must not take privileged actions on their own behalf.

This community is currently run by a [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life), and the moderators they appoint at their discretion. We are committed to stepping down as and when requested by community consensus, and can only hope that once this community reaches a size suitable for community elections you'll finally let us rest instead of continuing to elect us.

Banned or otherwise aggrieved members of our community are, as anyone else, welcome to take advantage of our world's open-source licensing to continue to participate with The Grand Empty in whatever successor communities they build.

# About
This community was founded in May 2025. These rules and principles are based on model rules adapted from the Worldbuilding Showcase discord community.
