title: Roleplay
parent: Introduction
---

This community is centered around an advanced literate play-by-post roleplaying game. That is to say: A semi-improvisatory collaborative group storytelling activity, conducted principally through short story segments writers submit as part of a larger running story, in which participants have defined storytelling responsibilities centered around the perspectives and actions of specific characters.

When you participate on this site, you are a writer first and foremost. This attempts to describe the set of norms and social expectations that apply to writers here --- but it's not the ultimate source of truth on what those norms and expectations are, the community itself is.

## Staying In-Scope
Writing is a creative exercise, and the most important creative constraint is _scope_, i.e: What is the shared story _about_? Scope changes over time as different writers introduce new themes and ideas at its frontier or abandon previously-accepted themes and ideas; and different scenes within the shared story can have different scopes. However, going too far out of scope disrespects the contributions and participation of other writers.

Our story is not about characters or events whose scenes would be needlessly tedious or unpleasant for other writers to collaborate on, or that unfairly crowd or exclude existing ideas from being explored. Certain topics, such as descriptions of blood, violence, or sex, are only in scope when marked with an appropriate content warning, and require the consent of the scene's participants. And some topics, such as underage sexuality, will _always_ be out-of-scope for this community.

### Mindful Writing Goals
The reasons we write can often be deeply personal. Roleplay writing can help a writer develop their writing skills in an unfamiliar genre or format, explore a special interest needed to accurately portray some detail, learn empathy for an unfamiliar viewpoint, come to terms with past trauma, or even explore a specific power fantasy or sexual kink. Personal writing goals such as these are nigh-unimpeachable, but it's important to be self-aware about what your goals are. The more personal the goal, the easier it is to lose sight of the goals themselves in favor of specific ideas you have for how to pursue them, and the harder it is to refine those ideas into a form suitable for our shared story.

This community is for writers who mean to take their craft seriously and invest in active improvement. Mistakes and failures are a part of growth --- but so is taking responsibility for them and actively engaging with criticism. Not every scene needs to be a challenge, but writers are expected to actively challenge themselves with characters and scenes that push the edges of their comfort zone and skill set.

Writers with a history of discussing their goals frankly and engaging with criticism are more readily trusted to interpret and direct the story's scope, and are generally allowed broader latitude to write challenging ideas and take on character roles with broader potential impact.

## Characters
Stories are about characters who experience conflict, make difficult choices, and change as a result. As a writer, you are responsible for telling parts of a single shared story with the other writers by narrating short individual posts within specific scenes within that larger shared story. 

### Viewpoint Characters
Writers develop, write and maintain individual rosters of **Viewpoint Characters** (i.a. PCs, main characters, protagonists). The designs of these characters are often carefully chosen and deeply personal to their writer, and their scene-to-scene continuity allows their use in exploring larger themes, especially the relationships they develop with other characters and the ways they change over time.

#### *With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility*
As a writer, you have almost absolute autonomy over the actions and words for your viewpoint characters, but in turn you carry final responsibility for exercising that autonomy wisely to ensure that the way you write them remains in-scope. Your interpretation of your characters is not above criticism, especially when it impacts other writers' character autonomy.

#### Autonomy Does Not Mean Sovereignty
It is not generally appropriate for a writer to write specific non-obvious character actions or dialogue for other writers' viewpoint characters, but it can be appropriate to assume an inconsequential automatic reaction --- such as reciprocating to a high-five or handshake. Even so, a skilled writer avoids explicitly stating those reactions and prefers to only imply them.

#### Stories are about Failure
Characters have self-interested goals and take actions to further those goals, but your goals as a writer are intrinsically at odds with your characters' goals.

As a writer, your job is to explore the way your character's attempts to reach their goals unfold, and how the character responds and changes in the process. As part of this, it's essential for you to intentionally seek out and engineer opportunities for your character to fail, and to ensure that any eventual success you engineer is justified by the way the character has developed in the process of reaching it.

### Incidental Characters
Writers are also expected to develop and write **Incidental Characters** (i.a. NPCs, mooks, extras). These characters are defined not by a narrative viewpoint, but by the role they play in the world and story. They are often used to fill out scenes or provide sources of conflict. Most are discarded after a single appearance or interaction, but it's not rare for a writer to find these roles meaningful enough to adopt them as a viewpoint character later.

#### Character Reuse
Writers are encouraged to re-use and re-interpret others' incidental characters. Others with experience writing them will often have useful insights in how to interpret or use them effectively, and may even be willing to reprise that role themselves; but when they don't or can't, the expectation for a new writer adhere to an older interpretation is usually minimal.

#### Character Self-Interest
Your goals as a writer are intrinsically at odds with the goals of your viewpoint characters, but incidental characters are a grey area. Keeping a character's self-interest in mind is especially important when this could put the character at odds with one of yours, but always keep in mind the needs of the story. Incidental characters should be designed to facilitate the story more than the other way around.

## Improvisation
Roleplay is an intrinsically improvisatory activity. While the rules used for live improv theater are not quite the same or quite so absolute when applied to play-by-post, all the same principles apply.  
Ours is a *semi*\-improvisatory format, and to the extent that things can be discussed out-of-character and different plans made these rules are even less absolute than normal.

But in general, when you write:

### Make Choices

Make meaningful choices, and describe those choices with a level of detail that allows other writers to understand them. Other writers rely on information they receive from you to play their own part. Your posts should answer the implicit questions posed by their previous posts, and pose implicit questions for them to answer.

Other writers are not entitled to make meaningful choices about the actions your characters take, therefore often those implicit questions will be specifically about your character --- such as waiting for them to speak. Be wary about this, though: you still have the responsibility to make choices about other elements of the scene. Writing a character to take the obvious action or make the obvious comment does not usually amount to a meaningful choice, especially not when another writer has already implied that reaction.

If another writer's character stands watch listening for footsteps, describe the sounds of your character's feet on the deck plating as they approach; and anything else about your character, so they can determine how the guard alerts, if they call "who goes there" or remain asleep or raise the alarm.

### Say "Yes, and..."

Participate in the conflicts and themes that other players have already established, and incorporate choices other writers have made into your writing.  

If another writer describes a doorway, write your character to enter the scene via that doorway. If another writer has described the occasion for a party, write your character dressed for that occasion. If there is an ongoing conflict, select a character to write who can participate in that conflict. And if another writer's character sets out a trap or intends to deceive yours, you should almost always write your character to fall for it.

### No Negation

Accept what other writers post as canonical fact for a scene. Detail within a scene overrides any more general source of 'canon', including this guidebook. Telling meaningful stories often requires bending the truth, and "don't let the truth get in the way of a good story" applies double when that "truth" is itself a work of fiction.  

Writers are expected to roll with deviations as best they are able. If something is a real problem, discuss this with the other writers, or choose to participate in a scene you understand better. Don't unilaterally contradict something someone else wrote, even as or against something written as character dialogue, unless it's discussed out-of-character first.

### Everything Affects You
Ensure your character remains in a position to be affected by choices that other writers make, and leave most elements you make choices about open to extension or modification by other writers.

When you write superman, make sure kryptonite is readily to hand. A set of chairs should include enough for the next writer's character to take a seat. Don't let the cult roster be comprehensive, when it could have a bloodstain obscuring a few names instead! A family tree is an invitation for new long-lost cousins and heirs, and a furnished backstory should have closets just itching to open and let skeletons out.

### Physicalize
Show, don't tell! Provide sensory details about a character's experience, and articulate the mental states and reasoning for your character's actions. Every post should include _some_ detail that goes beyond just their dialogue and actions --- tell us about your character's environment, outfit, situation, ideas, goals...

Write the vase of flowers sitting on the table, the metallic taste of the recycled water, the whirrs and clanks of machinery, the glow of planetshine through the window, the blistering heat of the nearby star. Tell of how a character's clothes drift and float in microgravity, of the reassuring tyranny as centrifucal force pulls at their fatigued limbs yet coriolis force points them the way. Tell where they hope this sense of direction will lead them. Tell us what the flowers _mean!_

## Plotting and Scheming
While the 'main' activity of roleplay is writing roleplay posts, it's equally important to participate in out-of-character discussion.

### Architects and Explorers
Different people have different preferences for how much they will pre-plan about what they write. Some writers choose to develop detailed character arcs with elaborately engineered schemes for how they will challenge their characters to develop them; others choose to follow the flow and their sense for what a character is and how they think, and find the story they are writing along the way.

Both approaches are valuable and necessary for a healthy roleplay community. A skilled writer actively engages in both types of writing, rather than exclusively one or the other.

### No Secrets
When we write, it's often artistically useful to bury the lede, engaging to write characters' attempts at deception, and entirely unavoidable to write characters who are ignorant --- but out-of-character, there are no secrets in the writing room.

A skilled writer is frank and transparent about their plans, goals, intentions, and opinions. Often, those intentions are sufficiently clear from the story writing itself, but it's always appropriate to expand on them or ask questions about others' writing.

This includes, with limited exception for harassment and similar issues, all of this community's staff operations. Discussions about community events are open for all writers to participate in.

### Active Criticism
When a reader thinks they know how to fix something, they are often wrong; but when they say there is a problem, they are usually right.

As writers, we rely on others in the community to help us grow by turning a critical perspective to our work. Our friends do us no favor when they leave a dissatisfaction with our writing unremarked, even when they too lack the skill to see how it could be resolved.

Criticism is not inherently a request to fix something already written, and when it is it may still sometimes be better to leave it unaddressed rather than pay the time cost. We may disagree with the criticism: pointing out detail the critic missed, rebutting it with counter-arguments, or even simply stating so.

When we criticize, we criticize only the writing, _never_ the writer; and when we disagree with criticism, we do so agreeably. We criticize narrowly and plainly, and avoid patronizing with obvious suggestions.

Criticism is our gift and responsibility to accept it in the same impersonal spirit it is given. A minor criticism flatters us by how meager it is and reassures us our writing is enjoyed, and even a harsh criticism is an opportunity we wouldn't dare squander by taking offense or apologizing for unnecessarily.

Some may find this attitude to criticism uncomfortable. Cherish your discomfort! In the most literal possible sense, that is what _learning_ feels like: i.e. the physiological sensation that comes from exerting the neurological pathways that ready you for memory encoding.

### Your Character Is An Idiot
As a writer, you will know information that your characters would not know. Our goal as writers is to engineer our characters to fail more than to succeed, and while it's not always wrong to have a character infer or intuit things, out-of-character information should be used to make characters *wrong* about things perhaps even more often than it should be used to make them right.

### Your Character Is An Asshole
Characters are not perfect, and characters who are even *close* are usually boring (and therefore out-of-scope). Your characters need to grow and develop: that can mean having them become less *or* more flawed, and many of the obstacles that lead them to develop will be their own mistakes, missteps, and sins.

Characters who behave in antisocial ways often make for good stories, but it's especially important to communicate when you write one, because a scene needs to be enjoyed by all of the writers collaborating on it.

Avoid rationalizing character actions. Be frank about your characters' unflattering motives. Avoid using euphemisms for things your character does, says, or thinks. Rationalizing and using euphemisms are something for your character to do, not for you as a writer to do when discussing them with other writers out-of-character. The more you embrace the degree to which your character is factually an asshole, the easier it is to make them an *interesting* asshole.

### Engineer Situations For More Than Just You

Like you, other writers have their own goals for how their characters should develop. While you too can develop plans all on your own, the best plans are the ones made in collaboration with multiple other writers. Likewise, other writers may have ideas that are useful to you; even scenes that don't seem to help your goals for your characters can usually be made to with a bit of discussion.

A plan that involves a specific character needs to be planned in collaboration with that character's writer; plans involving a character made without their writer are not always violations of autonomy per-se (you're allowed to dream), but putting them into practice to railroad a character *is* a violation even if those involved manage to avoid posting specific character actions and dialogue.

### Always Stick to the Plan

Writers may have carefully-orchestrated plans for their characters, and need other writers in a scene they are writing to help them execute those plans. Your characters or writing style may not always be a perfect fit for these plans, and it's often necessary to discuss in advance how the other writer's plans can be made to work with what you want to write. You may have alternative ideas that you think would serve the other writer's goals, so discuss them and see if they can agree --- but don't just decide that on your own; they may have other considerations you haven't the least idea about. Even when things go off the rails, try to write in a way that still helps them satisfy their same goals.

### Never Stick to the Plan

Sun tzu once wrote that no plan survives contact with other writers, or something like that. When you set up excessively elaborate plans that require specific sequences of events, you set yourself up for failure. Life is unpredictable, so are other people, and characters are not going to do or say exactly the things that you expect them to. While you might be able to get one specific boat to move the way you want, there's no use trying to command the tide.

Plan for overarching themes and outcomes more than for specific moments. Don't tell other writers what their characters should do, tell them what you are trying to accomplish in the scene and let them supply how their characters can make that happen --- other writers hate being told what to do, but they love being brought in and made part of the process.

Sometimes, a plan you've made will become so far derailed that its original goal will seem or perhaps even be impossible. As a writer you should embrace this, because embedded in this is always an opportunity to write something you might never have managed on your own: now you get to write a doomed hero to a cathartic death barely short of sainthood, use their ignominy to comment on the injustice inherent in systems of power, or perhaps even invent some new *villainous* end.
