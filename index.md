We are an advanced-literate sci-fi horror discord roleplay writing community, focused on encouraging writers to challenge themselves to grow and develop their skills.

Some of you may never have participated in roleplay before, that's fine! We're happy to invest in writers of all skill levels, so long as you are willing to learn.

Those of you who with more experience in roleplay communities may find our approach to the hobby unusual. We treat this hobby seriously, and encourage each and every writer to take on characters and ideas at the frontier of their skills and comfort. It's through open collaboration, mindful criticism, and active discussion that we learn to slay our demons and explore ideas that not one of us could ever have achieved on our own.

Writer's block is _just_ a skill issue.
